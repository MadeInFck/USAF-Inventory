					Damaged in forced landing at Snavudden, Roxen, Östergötland 12Sep61. During the flight Ängelholm
					to Hässlö severe engine vibrations occurred at 500mtr altitude approximately ten km north of Roxen.
					The pilot decided that the engine did not have sufficient power to complete the planned flight and
					assessed the height to be too low for parachute jumping. The terrain was completely unsuitable for
					an emergency landing, so he decided to land in the water at Roxen. The ditching on the water was
					successful, the pilot was unharmed and able to swim to shore. The airplane sank within minutes.
					The engine malfunction had been caused by the flap housing to the outlet valve in one of the engine
					cylinders ruptured and separated from the cylinder head so that the valve did not work. SOC 30Jan62.

				2064 (MSN 2607) 1080th Two-Engine Flying Training Squadron, Freeman Field, Seymour, IN. Mid-air
					collision with Beech AT-10 42-2126 approaching to land at Freeman Field 18Sep43. The instructor
					was demonstrating a single-engine landing to his student. His altitude was slightly lower than
					normal as only one engine was producing power. The other aircraft was approaching to land
					and was above and slightly behind, unable to see the lower aircraft. At about 50 ft, the higher
					aircraft struck this aircraft causing damage to the propellers and upper fuselage but the
					pilot was able to make a normal landing. Fatal crash ten miles east of North Vernon, IN 23Mar44.

				2094 (MSN 2637) 1079th Two-Engine Flying Training Squadron, Freeman Field, Seymour, IN. Demonstrating
					to a student a crosswind landing at Freeman Field 28Oct43, a foot, wearing heavy winter flying
					boots, slipped off the brake pedal and jammed, making it impossible to release the brake.
					In trying to hold the airplane straight, the other brake was applied which resulted in the aircraft
					nosing over, damaging the propellers and engine nacelles.
				2095 (MSN 2638) 1079th Two-Engine Flying Training Squadron, Freeman Field, Seymour, IN. Crash landed
					when the student pilot forgot to lower the wheels prior to landing at Freeman Auxiliary Field #2,

				2097 (MSN 2640) W/o 10 Jan 1945 at South City, IN 
				2098 (MSN 2641) 466th Two-Engine Flying Training Squadron, Freeman Field, Seymour, IN. During a check ride,
					the student was given a single-engine landing on the downwind leg. The student failed to raise
					the landing gear as per SOP; the check pilot retracted the landing gear. On the approach to land,
					the student failed to lower the landing gear and the check pilot failed to physically check
					the landing gear position. The aircraft crash landed at Freeman Field 8Oct43, damaging the
					engine nacelles and propellers. Force landed near Freeman Field 23Nov43. The pilot was making
					a simulated single-engine landing and attempted a go-around. The idling engine would not pick
					up power; unable to hold altitude on one engine the pilot elected to crash land straight
					ahead in a field adjoining the airfield, damaging the engine nacelles and propellers.
				2099 (MSN 2642) 466th Two-Engine Flying Training Squadron, Freeman Field, Seymour, IN. Damaged landing
					at Freeman Field 21Nov43. The pilot used excessive force on the left brake trying to correct a
					swing to the right, causing the aircraft to tip onto its nose, damaging both propellers and then
					settle back to a three-point attitude. Crashed after fuel exhaustion in bad weather and the
					crew bailed out five miles east of Carthage, IN 22Feb44.

				2260 (MSN 2803) 1079th Two-Engine Flying Training Squadron, Freeman Field, Seymour, IN. The landing
					gear collapsed during takeoff from Freeman Field 23Oct43, damaging the propellers and engine
					nacelles. Mid-air collision with Beech AT-10 41-27324 on final approach to land at Freeman
					Auxiliary Field #2, St Anne, IN 13Nov43. While on base leg, the pilot noticed another airplane
					on the inside and slightly behind his traffic pattern. Increasing his pattern to make room,
					the pilot turned to make a normal approach. About 50 ft from the ground, the aircraft struck
					an airplane ahead with the left engine. This airplane stalled and struck the ground nose first,
					cart wheeled tearing off an engine and a wing. Neither occupant was seriously injured.
				2262 (MSN 2805) 467th Two-Engine Flying Training Squadron, Freeman Field, Seymour, IN. Damaged when
					nosed over landing at Freeman Field 15Oct43. The runway was segregated into two and being used
					by different aircraft for takeoffs and landings at separate ends. The aircraft landed long and,
					in an attempt to avoid a collision with aircraft ahead waiting to takeoff, both pilots used
					excessive force on the brakes, causing the aircraft to tip onto its nose. Damaged when nosed over
					landing at Freeman Field 16Nov43. The aircraft started to pull to the left and it was found that
					he brake had seized. When the airplane speed had decayed it tipped onto its nose, causing damage
					to the propellers. An oil leak had contaminated the brake which was also very dusty.

				2336 (MSN 2879) 1079th Two-Engine Flying Training Squadron, Freeman Field, Seymour, IN. The instructor
					was demonstrating a simulated single-engine landing at Freeman Auxiliary Field #1, Walesboro, IN
					4Sep43. When power was applied for a go-around, icing conditions prevented the right engine from
					increasing power. The airspeed was too low for a single-engine go-around so a forced landing was
					made in a farmer's field off the end of the runway. The tail wheel hooked a fence and the
					aircraft landed on uneven ground causing damage to the left wing tip, propellers and engine nacelles

					Germany 4Mar43. The weather was bad from takeoff through to Germany preventing four other groups
					rendezvousing with the 91st Bomb Group which proceeded alone to the target. Sixteen planes faced the
					toughest fighter defence of the war, the heaviest flak areas, and on the deepest penetration yet
					into Germany. The reception was immediate with German fighters determined to stop the attack; the
					return flight home was no easier, flying into the wind of a strong jet stream. Mobile Repair Unit,

					Failed to return from mission to the Robert Bosch magneto factory at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43
					(10RMC). Enemy fighters were seen en route to the target but did not attack; flak was encountered
					most of the way in, becoming heavy approaching the target. Cloud cover over most of northwest France
					and Germany caused the formation to become disorganized and separated. This formation bombed a
					target of opportunity, an unknown marshalling yard in the vicinity of Strasbourg, France. It was
					vulnerable to enemy fighter attack and difficult for the P-47 Thunderbolts escorts to cover. With
					fuel exhaustion just as it reached the English south coast, the crew bailed out over Winchelsea

					Fighter opposition was weak but intense, heavy and accurate flak was encountered over the target.
					On the return journey, the combat wing leader took a course that led the formation near Antwerp,
					Belgium, and subjected the aircraft to severe flak defenses in that vicinity. Battle damaged on a
					Crossbow mission to a German V-1 flying bomb launch site at Gueschart in the Pas-de-Calais, France
					14Jan44. The lead squadron was on its bomb run for the primary target when intense flak was
					encountered. Violent evasive action caused the bomb sight gyroscope to tumble. On the second bomb
					run, the formation was on a collision course with the 379BG formation. They turned and bombed the
					low squadron's target at Le Meillard. No enemy fighters were encountered. Battle damaged during a

					anti-aircraft fire was encountered for almost the entire time that the Group was over enemy territory.
					Clouds and haze prevented the squadron from seeing the target and made additional bomb runs; flak
					over the target area was intense and extremely accurate at the low altitude flown. Battle damaged on

					crossing the enemy coast where there was moderate and inaccurate flak. At the target flak was
					intense and accurate. Battle damaged on a mission to the submarine yards at Pointe de Keroman,
					Lorient, Brittany, France 6Mar43. Flak over the target was intense and accurate; enemy fighters made
					feeble attacks after the target. Attacked by enemy fighters and struck by flak over the target
					causing large holes in wings and fuselage as well as compete electrical system failure. The no.3
					supercharger was disabled but the plane landed as planned at RAF Exeter, Devon. VIII Air Service
					Command 7Mar43. Regained by Group 17Apr43. Battle damaged on a mission to the submarine yards at
					Wilhelmshaven, Germany 21May43. Enemy opposition was intense with a large force of fighters first
					encountered near Heligoland island but did not attack until the formation reached the I.P. Flak over
					the target was moderate to intense and accurate. Fighting continued until the formation was well out
					to sea on the return home. Battle damaged on a mission to lock gates in the port of Saint-Nazaire,
					France 29May43. A small force of enemy fighters was encountered, but only a few came within range.
					Moderate flak was encountered over Guernsey and moderate, accurate flak over the target. Battle
					damaged on a mission to the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft (Deschimag)
					shipyard at Bremen, Germany 13Jun43. Enemy fighter opposition was light; heavy but inaccurate flak
					was encountered over the target. Battle damaged on a mission to a Luftwaffe aircraft repair depot at
					Villacoublay, Paris, France 29Jun43. Enemy fighter opposition was first encountered at the I.P. and
					continued back to the French coast then light flak passing out over Dieppe. Left elevator and
					horizontal stabilizer badly damaged by bullets and were replaced. Battle damaged on a mission to the
					Ernst Heinkel Flugzeugwerke aeronautical workshops on the airfield at Château-Bougon near Nantes,
					France 4Jul43. Flak over the target was heavy and accurate; enemy fighter opposition was strong from
					after the target until well out to sea on the return. Major battle damage on a mission to the S
					cholven AG synthetic fuel hydrogenation plant at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 12Aug43. Because of solid
					clouds at the Initial Point, the Group diverted and bombed the synthetic oil refinery at
					Recklinghausen, Germany. There was intense enemy fighter opposition from the I.P. which continued
					until the P-47 escort arrived on the way out. Flak in the Ruhr valley was heavy, intense and
					accurate, forming a solid wall in the target area. The Group was attacked by a flight of Fw 190
					fighters firing 20mm cannon shells into the formation. One of the shells penetrated the cockpit and
					exploded, shrapnel hitting the co-pilot. The plane had taken a number of hits; no.4 engine was out
					of service and the left wing had been struck about halfway between the no.1 engine and the wing tip.
					As a result of this damage, the plane was knocked out of formation and lost altitude. The pilot kept
					the plane in a controlled, steep dive until it reached 8,000ft. The bomber encountered further enemy
					attacks shortly before reaching the North Sea. The rest of the return trip was uneventful as the
					plane landed at base with the left wing still hanging on, but drooping almost to the ground at the
					tip. There was other damage by 20mm cannon shells to no.1 propeller, no.4 engine, and dorsal fin as
					well as flak damage throughout the plane. VIII Air Service Command 12Aug43. 534th Bomb Squadron,

					Destroyed while parked in a collision by B-17F 42-5751 during takeoff at Gowen Field 13Apr43. The
					sortie for B-17F 42-5751 was an instrument check ride which included a blind takeoff and the student
					was taking his first check. The B-17 started to takeoff with the student under the hood and an
					instructor pilot sitting in the right hand seat. The airplane ran 1,550 feet down the runway then
					turned off the runway under full power. It was straightened out momentarily while still under full
					power and swerved further to the right. Finally, after proceeding in a wide arc for approximately
					3/10 of a mile from the runway, it hit the left wing of B-17F 42-29548 parked on the north side of
					the ramp. It swung further to the right, still under full power at an estimated speed of 70 or 80
					miles an hour and proceeded south across the ramp. It collided with the transformers furnishing
					power to one of the main water wells on the field and smashed head-on into another parked plane,
					B-17F 42-2987. Both planes were badly damaged and fire started, without an explosion, which
					completely destroyed both planes. Surveyed 14Apr43.

					marshalling yards at Hamm, Germany 4Mar43. The weather was bad from takeoff through to Germany
					preventing four other groups rendezvousing with the 91st Bomb Group which proceeded alone to the
					target. Sixteen planes faced the toughest fighter defence of the war, the heaviest flak areas, and
					on the deepest penetration yet into Germany. The reception was immediate with German fighters
					determined to stop the attack; the return flight home was no easier, flying into the wind of a
					strong jet stream. Two engines were disabled but the plane returned safely to base. VIII Air Service
					Command 4Mar43. Regained by Group 5Apr43. Assigned to UGLY (Britain) 19Apr43. Battle damaged on a
					mission to the submarine construction yards at Wilhelmshaven, Germany 15May43. Weather over the
					target was bad and conditions were unfavourable for bombing; the Group turned to an alternate target,
					naval facilities on Heligoland island, Germany. A large force of enemy fighters attacked the
					formation viciously during the bomb run. Flak was meagre and inaccurate. Damaged by flak and 0.50
					calibre cannon shells. Mobile Repair Unit, VIII Air Service Command 22May43. Regained by Group
					19Jun43. Battle damaged on a mission to the Gerhard Fieseler Werke (GFW) aircraft factory at Waldau,
					Kassel, Germany 30Jul43. En route the combat wing encountered a large force of enemy fighters
					beginning near Antwerp, Belgium and continuing until out at sea on the way home. Intense and very
					accurate flak was experienced over the target; along the route to/from the target flak was meagre
					and inaccurate. Battle damaged on a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Evere, Brussels, Belgium
					15Aug43. Weather over the Belgian coast was overcast and the formation headed for the Luftwaffe
					airfield at Vlissingen, Netherlands. Moderate, accurate flak was experienced over target area.
					Battle damaged on a mission to the Luftwaffe airfield and air depot at Le Bourget, Paris, France
					16Aug43. Enemy fighters were seen, although they stayed with the formation for only a short time;
					some flak was encountered, it was only moderate but accurate. Failed to return from a mission to
					ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt, Germany 17Aug43 (2KIA:4POW:4EVD). The formation was subject
					to continuous fighter attacks from the time it crossed over the enemy coast. In addition, the
					bombers were hit by flak as they passed over anti-aircraft defence zones. Nearing the target, enemy
					aircraft hit no.2 engine turbocharger and the aircraft dropped back from the formation. The bombs
					were jettisoned but the plane was unable to keep up with the group. Vulnerable, more fighters
					attacked and the pilot turned back for England. Approaching Brussels, Belgium, the bomber was again
					attacked by enemy fighters wounding the radio operator. Shot down by Oberleutnant von Arnim of
					5./(F) 123. The crew bailed out but the pilot remained to keep the plane steady and was killed when
					the plane crashed at Montroeul-au-Bois, southwest of Frasnes-lez-Anvaing, Hainaut, Belgium.

					Moses Lake 21Jun43 (8KIS). The aircraft left Moses Lake Army Air Field with ten bombs on a routine
					training mission. One radio operator on another B-17 about ten miles away reported seeing a B-17
					apparently practicing stalls, and that it seemed 'out of the ordinary', but he did not see it crash.
					Another aircraft was apparently nearby when 42-2998 crashed. The pilot stated that he saw the tail
					and then wings depart the aircraft, and had to change his heading to avoid possible parachutes or
					wreckage. Given the information in the accident report, it seems likely that the pilot had been
					practicing stalls after dropping bombs and somehow either became disoriented or lost control. The
					aircraft went into a dive and broke up. There was no explosion, although there were some small fires
					at the scene of the crash. Class 26; ground instructional airframe 26Aug43.

					(Britain) 17Apr43. {first combat mission 1May43}. Battle damaged on a mission to the U-boat base and
					shipyard at Saint-Nazaire, France 1May43. Flak over the target was slight to moderate but inaccurate.
					On return a navigational error took the entire formation at low level over the Brest peninsula where
					light and heavy flak was fired from land and navy flak boats, fragmenting the group. German fighters
					arrived on the scene, quickly exploited the situation and began concerted attacks. VIII Air Service
					Command 3May43. Regained by Group 10May43. VIII Air Service Command 20May43. Regained by Group
					24May43. 427th Bomb Squadron. Failed to return from a mission to the Robert Bosch electrical factory
					at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43 (10RMC). Enemy fighters were seen en route to the target but did not
					attack; flak was encountered most of the way in, becoming heavy approaching the target. From the
					Initial Point until leaving the target area, there was a complete undercast except for small sparse
					patches of farm land. The group had a difficult time locating one of the targets and bombs were
					dropped at several different times on the city of Stuttgart. Having circled the target area several
					times, this had a disastrous effect on fuel consumption; the planes didn't have any reserve fuel.
					Over the target area the Group met the most fighter opposition of the mission; fighter opposition
					was meagre on the rest of the mission. The pilot was taking violent evasive action to avoid fighters
					on the tail after leaving the target. The crew was figuring their fuel consumption all the way and
					knew over Germany that the best they could hope for was to ditch in the English Channel and that
					they possibly might not get out of France. About halfway across France the crew started jettisoning
					excess equipment to reduce the weight and aid fuel consumption, just keeping enough ammunition to
					ward off fighter attacks. Twenty miles short of the French coast the plane was alone because it had
					gradually lagged behind the formation. The plane left the French coast at 14,000 feet; by that time
					the crew had started throwing out gun barrels. Before leaving France, no.1 and no.3 engines had
					stopped with fuel exhaustion. Soon after leaving France the bailout alarm was sounded and the crew
					except the pilot and co-pilot assembled in the radio room to prepare for ditching. Soon no.2 engine
					stopped. At about 1,000 feet the pilot said he was going straight for a boat he had seen. The plane
					made a nice landing into the wind; the tail hit first then the nose and whole fuselage hit and it
					stopped dead with a violent jolt. The water immediately rushed in from the bomb bays and the camera
					well as the plane seemed to be sinking fast. The bomber ditched in the English Channel six miles
					southwest of Beachy Head, Sussex, narrowly missing a couple of minefileds; the crew was immediately
					rescued by British Air-Sea Rescue launch and taken to Newhaven, Sussex. Assigned to SOXO (Britain
					Zone I). Condemned Air Force Service Command 6Sep43. THE OLD SQUAW.

					{first combat mission 17Apr43}. Received a field modification to counter the German tactic of head
					on attacks; the bombsight was removed, a twin 0.50 caliber gun was installed and armoured plate to
					protect the gunner. Battle damaged on a mission to the submarine yards at Kiel, Germany 14May43
					(1WIA:9RMC). Flak over the target was moderate. Enemy air opposition was heavy with a large force
					of fighters. The German fighters began their attacks as soon as the bombers crossed the German coast
					and kept up a running fight until they had dropped their bombs, turned back, and were well out to
					sea. Battle damaged on a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Gilze-Rijen, Netherlands 19Aug43. With
					haze prior to the Initial Point, over the target moderate and accurate flak was coming from the
					centre of the target and the lead bombardier was unable synchronize the bomb sight. Going round for
					another run over the target, the formation was heading into the sun causing the bombers to drop
					their bombs haphazardly, none hitting the target. By this time other groups were heading home along
					with their fighter escort. The formation was then attacked by a small force of enemy fighters. No. 4
					engine was struck, caught fire but later extinguished. Battle damaged during a mission to railway
					marshalling yards at Münster, Germany 10Oct43. Ground haze made visibility in the target area very
					poor. The 384th Bomb Group led the combat wing across the northern end of the Ruhr Valley over Hüls,
					subjecting the formation to the fire of approximately one hundred flak guns. The fire was extremely
					accurate for altitude and deflection; the lead Group took no evasive action. At the start of the
					bomb run, the lead bombardier observed a town burning and, mistaking it for the target, made the
					bomb run on it; the town was later identified as Coesfeld, Germany. Enemy fighters were observed but
					did not attack; the P-47 Thunderbolt escort gave excellent protection and coverage. Battle damaged
					during a mission to the Vereinigte Kugellagerfabriken AG (VKF) ball bearing works at Schweinfurt,
					Germany 14Oct43. En route to the target area, the bomber formation was repeatedly attacked by a l
					arge number of Luftwaffe fighters; moderate to intense flak was reported over the target. After the
					target, the Group turned and headed westward for England; moderate flak was encountered at various
					places during the return home. German fighters, having landed and refueled, attacked again until,
					finally, the bombers reached the coastline of western France and relative safety. Battle damaged
					during a mission to a railway marshalling yard at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 5Nov43. Fighter opposition
					was weak but intense, heavy and accurate flak was encountered over the target. On the return journey,
					the combat wing leader took a course that led the formation near Antwerp, Belgium, and subjected the
					aircraft to severe flak defenses in that vicinity. Battle damaged on a mission to the port area at
					Bremen, Germany 20Dec43. Attacked by a large force of enemy fighters; flak over the target area was
					very intense and accurate. Battle damaged on a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 fighter
					factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44. While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in
					ver English bases and a recall signal was issued. Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, Air Commander
					of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater
					exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the
					penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal support
					but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for themselves on
					the return trip. It proved to be the most disastrous of the 303rd Bomb Group combat missions flown
					to date; the 303rd lost eleven of the forty B-17s flying the mission. Luftwaffe attacks started over
					the IJsselmeer and intensified when the American fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate
					flak was experienced on the bomb run, with intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. During
					the a fighter attack, the plane received damage from a 20mm cannon shell that was fired from a
					little above and to the left of the cockpit, going just over the cockpit, grazing the fuselage,
					going through the right horizontal stabilizer and elevator; this shell didn't explode when it hit.
					Another cannon shell made a large hole through the no.3 engine oil cooler, just grazed a fuel tank
					and then struck the hydraulic line which operates the no.4 engine cowl flaps. Upon reaching England,
					the pilot found a very dense overcast. He finally located the runway and landed. Immediatelyupon
					touching the ground, he locked the brakes because he had landed too far down the runway for a normal
					landing roll. The plane slid both wheels - the runway was wet from the rain and sleet - and slid to
					a stop not more than thirty feet from the end of the runway. There was just enough room left to turn
					the plane around by locking one wheel and turning on a point. Failed to return from a Crossbow
					mission to a German V-1 flying bomb launch site at Gueschart in the Pas-de-Calais, France 14Jan44
					(11POW). The lead squadron was on its bomb run for the primary target when intense flak was
					encountered. Violent evasive action caused the bomb sight gyroscope to tumble. On the second bomb
					run, the formation was on a collision course with the 379BG formation. They turned and bombed the
					low squadron's target at Le Meillard. No enemy fighters were encountered. In the vicinity of Forêt
					de Crécy, France, the plane sustained a direct flak hit. The control cables were severed and the
					aircraft went out of control, spiralled towards the ground and exploded. The crew successfully
					bailed out and watched their B-17 crash near their landing area. It crashed near the anti-aircraft
					gun that shot them down, near the Forêt Domaniale de Crecy, Crécy-en Ponthieu, north of Abbeville,
					France. {35 missions}. WALLAROO.

					the combat wing across the northern end of the Ruhr Valley over Hüls, subjecting the formation to
					the fire of approximately one hundred flak guns. The fire was extremely accurate for altitude and
					deflection; the lead Group took no evasive action. At the start of the bomb run, the lead bombardier
					observed a town burning and, mistaking it for the target, made the bomb run on it; the town was
					later identified as Coesfeld, Germany. Enemy fighters were observed but did not attack; the P-47

					fighters came up, the formation managed to elude them by flying into a large cloud bank. On return a
					navigational error took the entire formation at low level over the Brest peninsula where light and
					heavy flak was fired from land and navy flak boats, fragmenting the group. German fighters arrived
					on the scene, quickly exploited the situation and began concerted attacks. Battle damaged on a

					fighters were scheduled to cover the whole route over enemy territory but were not on hand for
					approximately ten minutes between the I.P. and the target, during which time the Group was attacked
					by enemy fighters. The navigator was severely wounded by a 0.303 calibre slug. Major battle damage
					on a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 fighter factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44. Enemy
					fighter attacks were very numerous; flak was moderate but accurate due to the low altitude of the
					mission. Failed to return from an Operation Argument mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Gütersloh,
					Germany 21Feb44 (2KIA:8POW). En route to the target and flying over the North Sea, the spare element
					was lagging well behind the main body of the Group formation. About midway across the sea, the spare
					element was attacked by four Bf 109 fighters. Poor weather conditions over the primary target forced
					the formation to strike an alternate target, a Luftwaffe airfield at Achmer, Bramsche, Germany. The
					weather was poor that day, and things went wrong from the start. The First Bombardment Wing had no
					pathfinder aircraft; the fighter escort failed to meet them at the rendezvous point, and just as the
					large formation came to a place deep inside enemy territory where they needed to make a turn they
					flew into a large cloudbank. When they finally broke into the clear, this bomber was separated from
					the rest of the formation by about one mile. As the pilot attempted to rejoin the group, Fw 190s
					attacked and knocked out an engine, badly wounded the radio operator, killed the top turret gunner,
					shot away the rudder controls, and made many gun positions inoperable. The pilot reduced altitude,
					jettisoned the bombs, and turned for home. A second engine failed and the pilot gave the bail out
					order. Two men jumped, but one engine was restarted and the remaining crew decided to stay with the
					plane in hope of getting home safely. Flying over Germany at treetop level for more than an hour,
					they had the additional bad luck to fly right across a Luftwaffe fighter base. This time the plane
					came under attack by Major Heinz 'Pritzel' Bär of the VI./JG 1, flying an Fw 190 A-7 from Hopsten
					airfield, Rheine. A shell exploded inside the cockpit wounding the pilot and killing the co-pilot.
					The pilot successfully crash landed into an open field at Bexten, near Salzbergen, northwest of
					Rheine, Germany. {13 missions}. MISS OUACHITA - artwork of a young woman wearing a bathing suit and

					attack; flak was encountered most of the way in, becoming heavy approaching the target. From the
					Initial Point until leaving the target area, there was a complete undercast except for small sparse
					patches of farm land. This group went over the target area twice without dropping their bombs. Bombs
					were finally dropped on Achern, a small town 18km southwest of Baden-Baden, Germany. Having spent
					too long over the target, the formation was beginning to realise that fuel exhaustion would likely
					lead to many not being able to return to base. On the return home an inboard engine failed and the
					pilot dove for cloud cover. With the propeller feathered, the plane had lost sight of the formation
					when the other inboard engine failed. The remaining engines, running at higher power, were using up
					fuel and there was not enough to return to England. The pilot headed for France with a chance that
					the crew might be able to evade capture. The crew bailed out when the aircraft ran out of fuel and
					crashed on the side of a hill between Dorviller and Elvange, 32km east of Metz, France.

					at that time was approximately 6,000 feet. No parachutes were observed. Later, an attack by enemy
					fighters disabled no.2 and no.3 engines and set both wings on fire. The navigator, tail and ball
					turret gunners bailed out but the remaining crew were still onboard as the bomber crash landed in a
					field between Parthenay-de-Bretagne and Clayes at a place called 'Le Grand Clos', nine miles
					northwest of Rennes, France. Cutting through high voltage power lines caused ignition of the fuel
					and the plane exploded, scattering debris over several hundred yards towards farm buildings. Claimed

					Group 27Apr43. Battle damaged on a mission to the submarine yard at Bremen, Germany 11Jun43. With
					poor visibility over the target, the formation turned to the secondary target, the port facilities
					at Wilhelmshaven, Germany. The lead aircraft of the formation was hit by anti-aircraft fire while on
					the bomb run which knocked out two engines. A switch to the secondary target was initiated, causing
					some confusion among the groups from the I.P. on. Radio operator was looking upward from his post at
					the radio room gun and saw a higher group immediately overhead, their bomb bay doors open. Just
					after this plane dropped its bomb load and closed the bomb bay doors, two 500lb bombs dropped from
					the plane above, the first hitting the outer portion of the right horizontal stabilizer, the second
					chopping it completely off about two feet from the tail section. Loss of the stabilizer threw the
					plane completely out of control, causing it to plunge earthward. The plane didn't hit any others as
					it fell out of formation, but enemy fighters showed an interest Finally the pilot got the aircraft
					under some sort of control and cautiously slid over the middle of a lower group for fighter
					protection. The 91st bomb group went down over it and the fighters left them alone. Trying to fly
					formation, sandwiched between the two groups, was an almost impossible job. Over the North Sea the
					pilot left both groups for more manoeuvring space, and headed for Bassingbourn where it landed
					safely. Failed to return from a mission to ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt, Germany 17Aug43 (
					10RMC). The turbocharger on an engine failed during assembly and should have turned back. The pilot
					was determined to do his tour of duty and continued on using full power on the remaining three
					engines. The increased fuel consumption meant that it would not be able to make it back to a safe
					landing in England. The formation was subject to continuous fighter attacks from the time it crossed
					over the enemy coast. In addition, the bombers were hit by flak as they passed over anti-aircraft
					defence zones. Severely damaged by enemy aircraft, a 20mm cannon shell blew off the left wing tip
					and there was a large hole in the right horizontal stabilizer. Another cannon shell struck no.3
					engine; the pilot did not feather the propeller, hoping that enemy fighters would not realise that
					the bomber was in trouble. The bomb load was jettisoned but the crew continued to the target for
					protection by the group. The pilot kept up with the formation on return as far as the Belgian coast
					but was then down to two operating engines. As the bomber started a gentle glide across the North
					Sea the remaining two engines stopped because of fuel exhaustion. The aircraft ditched in the North
					Sea forty-five miles from the English coast, the crew being rescued by a Royal Air Force Air-Sea
					Rescue Supermarine Walrus amphibious aircraft from 277 Squadron, RAF Hawkinge, Kent. Unable to
					takeoff with a heavy load into the swell, the Walrus was taxyed to Ramsgate, Kent, arriving early
					the following morning. The pilot, who was on the first American raid of August 17, 1942 with 97th
					Bomb Group, said when picked up "This is a hell of a way to celebrate an anniversary." {17 missions}.

					accurate from the target to Abbeville. Flak hole through corrugation of left outer wing panel; flak
					hole in leading edge of left horizontal stabilizer; flak hole in right outer wing panel through the
					skin corrugation. Battle damaged during a mission to the Kriegsmarinewerft Kiel shipyard at Kiel,

					meagre and inaccurate from South Sylt and Amrum islands. After the target there was large enemy
					fighter opposition but did not press home their attacks. One flak hole right wing leading edge

					fighters beginning near Antwerp, Belgium and continuing until out at sea on the way home. Intense
					and very accurate flak was experienced over the target; along the route to/from the target flak was
					meagre and inaccurate. After the rally, the formation was south of course and struck by accurate,
					light flak near Hamm. A large force of enemy fighters came up to attack as the formation was nearing
					the enemy coast on the way home. While crossing the French coast on the way back, the four fuel
					warning lights came on. This was quite unexpected and caused consternation in the cockpit. The pilot
					elected to stay with the formation, but halfway across the North Sea one engine stopped. Feathering
					the propeller, the pilot put the plane into a shallow dive towards the English coast, aiming for an
					airstrip at RAF Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire. Lining up for the runway, the pilot discovered that the
					undercarriage would not lower as gunfire from fighter attacks had damaged it. Going around again,

					damaged on a mission to the submarine yards at Pointe de Keroman, Lorient, Brittany, France 17May43.
					The formation was attacked by a force of enemy fighters en route to the target and return as far as

					fighters en route to the target, the rudder controls were damaged. The bombardier and another crew
					member patched up the controls and the pilot was able to use it to return to England but it was not
					sufficiently robust to use for the landing. The pilot stalled the plane over the end of the runway
					by running over the grass while the co-pilot applied the brakes. Failed to return from a mission to
					a Luftwaffe aircraft repair depot at Villacoublay, Paris, France 14Jul43 (7KIA:4POW). Intense and
					accurate flak was encountered on crossing the coast into France but the heaviest and most accurate
					flak was fired from Le Havre as the Group returned home; there were some enemy fighters but these
					made very few attacks on the formation. Damaged by flak and, after extinguishing several fires, was
					attacked by enemy fighters setting fire to no.3 engine. A frontal attack sent the plane onto its

					flak or fighters were encountered in the target area. After bombing and leaving the target, the
					first flak was encountered at Rostock; it was intense and accurate. From the target to Rostock,

					(Station 121), Cambridgeshire 26Mar43. Battle damaged on a mission to the submarine yards at Kiel,
					Germany 14May43. Flak over the target was moderate. Enemy air opposition was heavy with a large
					force of fighters. The German fighters began their attacks as soon as the bombers crossed the German
					coast and kept up a running fight until they had dropped their bombs, turned back, and were well out
					to sea. The vertical stabilizer was badly damaged. Battle damaged on a mission to the submarine yard
					at Bremen, Germany 11Jun43. With poor visibility over the target, the formation turned to the
					secondary target, the port facilities at Wilhelmshaven, Germany. Flak was meagre and inaccurate.
					Enemy fighter attacks began at a point southwest of Heligoland and continued until the Group was
					about fifty miles off the German coast on the way home. Battle damaged on a mission to the Chemische
					Werke synthetic rubber works at Hüls, Marl, Germany 22Jun43 (1WIA:9RMC). Flak over the target was
					intense and the Group encountered strong enemy fighter attacks on the way home. The bombardier was
					wounded by the explosion of a 20mm cannon shell. Battle damaged on a mission to the Continental
					Gummiwerke A.G. synthetic rubber works at Nordhafen, Hannover, Germany 17Jul43. Weather caused the
					mission to be recalled before reaching the primary target. A few breaks in the clouds were occurring;
					the formation bombed a small, unidentified, village. Enemy fighter opposition began in the vicinity
					of the IJsselmeer after the formation turned back over Germany; it soon became determined and heavy,
					continuing to within sight of the English coast. Only a small amount of flak was encountered passing
					IJmuiden, Netherlands. Attacked by enemy fighters, the plane was damaged by several 20mm cannon
					shells. Enemy fighter attacks continued to within sight of the English coast. Battle damaged on a
					mission to the Luftwaffe airfield and air depot at Le Bourget, Paris, France 16Aug43. Enemy fighters
					were seen, although they stayed with the formation for only a short time; some flak was encountered,
					it was only moderate but accurate. Battle damaged on a mission to attack a submarine supply ship in
					the Loire River at Nantes, France 16Sep43. The ship was not found in the briefed area, so the Group
					attacked the secondary target, port facilities and shipping. There was moderate and accurate flak
					from Rennes but at Nantes the flak was moderate and inaccurate. A large force of enemy fighters was
					encountered. Battle damaged on a mission to attack the submarine supply ship 'Kertosono' moored at
					Nantes, France 23Sep43. Moderate and accurate flak over the target; a large force of enemy fighters
					was encountered to and from the target. Battle damaged on a mission to ball bearing factories at
					Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43 (1WIA:9RMC). En route to the target area, the bomber formation was
					repeatedly attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters; moderate to intense flak was reported
					over the target. After the target, the Group turned and headed westward for England; moderate flak
					was encountered at various places during the return home. German fighters, having landed and
					refuelled, attacked again until, finally, the bombers reached the coastline of western Europe and
					relative safety. A gunner was seriously wounded by a 20mm cannon shell. Failed to return from a
					mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 fighter factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44 (2KIA:8POW).
					While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and a recall signal was
					issued. Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to
					the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good
					fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the
					target. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer; meagre and fairly accurate flak was
					experienced on the bomb run. Despite the flak, four test pilots of the AGO Industrieschutzstaffel
					(Industrial protection squadron) took off with their Fw 190 A-7 fighters and began dog fighting west
					of Oschersleben. During the bomb run the bomber was attacked by a fighter and the left wing was set
					on fire next to the fuselage. The radio operator was fatally wounded, the other airmen bailed out
					over Ausleben, 10km northwest of Oschersleben; the pilot was killed when his parachute failed to
					open. Crashed into woods at Hohes Holz, near Altbrandsleben, 8km north-northeast of Oschersleben,
					Germany. Claimed by Fritz Kuhlmann who was injured during the attack. {23 missions}. PICADILLY

					Aktiengesellschaft (Deschimag) shipyard at Bremen, Germany 8Oct43 (2WIA:8RMC). The effectiveness of
					a smoke screen, in combination with a haze that extended to altitude, caused the Group to attack the
					secondary target, the city of Bremen. The formation was met with stiff resistance by German fighters
					the entire way, from the Dutch coast all the way to the target and back again. Over the Initial
					Point and the target, the Group encountered intense flak. The ball turret door came open causing the
					gunner to fall out head first. The gunner managed to pull himself back in but became caught in the
					mechanism. Assisted by the bombardier, the gunner was pulled out of the ball turret. Blood running
					from the gunner's forehead had frozen and he was choking on the ice. The bombardier removed the ice
					and dragged the gunner to the radio room. He survived and eventually returned to duty. Failed to
					return from a mission to the Rudolf Rautenbach aero engine casting foundry at Solingen, Germany
					1Dec43 (10POW). A force of enemy fighters was encountered in the vicinity of the Initial Point where
					the friendly fighter escort turned back; flak was intense and accurate. An attack by enemy aircraft
					damaged engines no.1 and no.4 and both propellers were feathered. The aircraft crash landed in a
					farm field, uphill on a small hill beside a valley at Boich, five miles south of Düren, Germany. The
					landing gear was sheared off when it struck a large pile of sugar beets. {6 missions}. Despite
					crew's attempts to destroy their aircraft, the Luftwaffe salvaged it for spares within four days.

					mission to the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft (Deschimag) shipyard at Bremen,
					Germany 8Oct43. Meagre and inaccurate flak was encountered at various points to and from the target.
					A large force of enemy aircraft was seen, but there were very few attacks. The effectiveness of the
					target smoke screen, in combination with a haze that extended to altitude, caused the Group to
					attack the secondary target, the city of Bremen. Over the target flak struck the plane, damaged an
					engine supercharger and caused an overspeeding propeller. Flying on three engines, the bomber fell
					behind the rest of the formation, but went on to bomb the target. Two bombs stuck in the racks and
					the bomb bay doors refused to close, slowing the plane down even more. To complicate matters, oxygen
					masks froze at the sub-zero altitude. The engineer went back to the bomb bay to try to close the
					doors and increase the speed of the plane a little. He dislodged the two bombs, which rolled out of
					the partially closed doors then he passed out from lack of oxygen on the narrow catwalk over the
					open bomb bay doors. Leaving the co-pilot to fly the plane, the pilot went back and gave the
					engineer oxygen to revive him. Battle damaged on a mission to the city of Bremen, Germany 26Nov43
					(1KIA:9RMC). Enemy fighter opposition was strong with attacks from the enemy coast to the target and
					back out to the coast. There was intense flak over Bremen but moderate and inaccurate elsewhere.
					Seriously damaged when three German fighters attacked as the bomber began its bomb run. Their 20mm
					cannons blasted out all of the Plexiglas in the Fortress' nose, killing the navigator, destroyed
					one-half of the oxygen system, disabled one engine, partially wrecked communication equipment and
					left a gaping hole in one wing. The bombardier was injured, his helmet and oxygen mask were torn
					away, and he lay gasping for breath as frigid winds in the -67F atmosphere whipped about his
					unprotected face and head. The top turret gunner and engineer assisted the co-pilot whose oxygen
					mask had been shot away; he also assisted the pilot with his oxygen mask and attempted to thaw out
					his frozen hands. In the meantime, the bombardier, barely conscious, realized that the enemy
					fighters were still attacking and struggled to get back to his nose guns. He exposed himself to the
					extreme cold blast through the nose and faced the possibility of being thrown out by evasive action;
					he remained at his guns until the attacks ceased. After landing, he was unconscious beneath his guns.
					Arriving back in England, the pilot, his frost bitten hands so stiff he could barely manipulate the
					throttles, made a forced landing at RAF Docking, Bircham Newton, Norfolk. As he landed, another
					engine stopped with fuel exhaustion. VIII Air Service Command. Regained by Group 28Feb44. 2nd

					home base. Heavy cloud formations were encountered along the route. Attacked by enemy fighters, the
					bombardier was struck by shrapnel from a 20mm cannon shell. Battle damaged on mission to
					Salon-de-Provence, France 27Jan44. The mission was against Luftwaffe He 111 and Ju 88 bombers and
					their base used to attack shipping supporting the Anzio beachhead. The enemy sent up flak and twenty
					to thirty fighters, some avoided the escort to on a forty-eight minute attack. {42 missions}. 348th

					Failed to return from a mission to Le Bourget, Paris, France 14Jul43 (2KIA:2POW:6EVD). Enemy fighter
					attacks were experienced en route to the target after the escort had to turn back. Before reaching
					the target, two enemy fighters exploded in front of the bomber. The pilot took severe evasive action
					and put the bomber in a steep dive as it dropped out of formation. No.3 engine had been damaged and
					the propeller oversped. By boosting all engines, the pilot caught up with his group but fell away
					again when no.3 propeller would not feather. A 20mm cannon shell burst in the bomb bay setting fire
					to an oxygen tank; the engineer reported that there was oil loss from no.3 and no.4 engines. Power
					was gone from three of the engines so the pilot ordered the crew to bail out and jettisoned the
					bombs. The two waist gunners had been fatally wounded by 20mm cannon shells. Four fighters were
					still attacking the plane as it crashed and exploded near the railway station at Louvres, north of
					Paris, France.

					Battle damaged on a mission to attack the submarine supply ship 'Kertosono' moored at Nantes,
					France 23Sep43. Before the target, the plane was attacked by enemy fighters and in poor weather,
					it became separated from the main formation. Not sure of his position, the pilot turned north
					knowing that he would soon be over the English Chanel heading for England. Leaking fuel from the
					enemy damage, the pilot headed across southern England and came to Whitchurch airfield on the
					outskirts of Bristol. With fuel exhaustion, the pilot force landed at Whitchurch, a civilian
					irfield used by BOAC and KLM. After refuelling, the plane departed for Bassingbourn later the same
					day. Battle damaged during a mission to the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft
					(Deschimag) shipyard at Bremen, Germany 8Oct43 (1WIA:9RMC). The formation was met with stiff r
					esistance by German fighters the entire way, from the Dutch coast all the way to the target and back
					again. Over the I.P. and the target, the Group encountered intense flak. The Plexiglas nose was
					shattered, wounding the bombardier. Battle damaged during a mission to the Arado Flugzeugwerke
					aircraft factory, Anklam, Prussia 9Oct43 (1WIA:9RMC). The formation was attacked by a large force of
					Luftwaffe fighters firing rockets soon after it crossed the Danish coast. They followed all the way
					in, attacking on the bomb run and over the target. Flak was meagre and inaccurate. Before reaching
					the target, the no.4 engine was disabled by an enemy fighter attack and the no.3 was damaged and
					smoking. The bomber continued and, having dropped its bombs, flak damaged the hydraulic system
					preventing closure of the bomb bay doors. Falling behind the formation, the bomber was continuously
					attacked by fighters; the bombardier was wounded on at least three separate occasions. Over the
					North Sea, the no.3 engine failed. The bomber dropped low to avoid fighters but managed to return to
					Bassingbourn where it was landed on the grass alongside the runway. The right main landing gear
					collapsed and the plane ground looped to stop it within the airfield boundary. Battle damaged during
					a mission to railway marshalling yards at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 5Nov43. Fighter opposition was weak
					but flak between the I.P. and over the target was intense causing numerous holes in the plane.
					Battle damaged during a mission to the port area at Bremen, Germany 26Nov43. Enemy fighter
					opposition was strong with attacks from the enemy coast to the target and back out to the coast.
					There was intense flak over Bremen but moderate and inaccurate elsewhere. Battle damaged during a
					mission to the port area at Bremen, Germany 13Dec43. Moderate to intense accurate flak was
					encountered over Den Helder at the Dutch coast; meagre, inaccurate flak was seen in the target area.
					The formation did not see any enemy fighters; fighter support was excellent. Battle damaged on a
					mission to a Messerschmitt Bf 110 aircraft component factory at Brunswick, Germany 30Jan44. The
					formation was subjected to two major enemy attacks, one just before the Initial Point to the target
					and the other on the way back from Dümmer See to the IJsselmeer. One fighter was reported attacking
					with an aerial bomb; other enemy aircraft dropped parachute bombs on the formation. Meagre,
					inaccurate flak was reported at Dümmer See, Minden and over the target; moderate flak was seen at
					Hannover. Attacked by enemy fighters damaging a wing leading edge. Failed to return from an
					Operation Argument mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Gütersloh, Germany 21Feb44 (10POW). Poor
					weather conditions over the primary target forced the formation to strike an alternate target, a
					Luftwaffe airfield at Achmer, Bramsche, Germany. Over the target a small force of enemy fighters was
					encountered; most of these did not make vigorous attacks, but there was considerable and accurate
					flak. The leader turned too sharply throwing the tail-end planes out of formation and exposed to
					attacks by enemy fighters over Holzminden. Engine no.3 was struck by a 20mm cannon shell which blew
					off the cowlings and blew out three cylinders. The propeller could not be feathered. Flight controls
					froze and the right wing was on fire. The crew bailed out before the plane exploded, the wreckage
					crashed on open fields in the district of Bischofshagen, northeast of Herford, Germany and debris
					was spread over a large area. Claimed by Lieutenant Hans Weik of X./JG 3, flying a Fw 190 A-8/R2,

					delivery flight from USA to UK, having departed from Menara Airport, Marrakech, French Morocco en
					route to St. Eval (Station 129), Cornwall, England 7Apr43. The pilot became lost and, with fuel
					exhaustion, was forced to land in Eire. The aircraft made a forced landing on White's Marsh,
					Garrnagoleen, near the town of Clonakilty on the south coast of Eire. The only victim of the
					incident was a small pet monkey the crew had obtained while flying through Brazil. Over the few days
					in Ireland, Tojo, as he had been named by the crew, succumbed to the climate and perhaps the
					hospitality and died. Condemned 21Apr43. Temporary steel planking was sent from Northern Ireland and
					a ferry crew sent south who managed to fly the stricken aircraft out of White's Marsh. It was flown
					to the airbase at Langford Lodge (Station 597), County Antrim, Northern Ireland and was delivered to
					the Lockheed Overseas Corporation, Base Air Depot No.3, where over a twenty-three day period it
					underwent a maintenance inspection and a post 200 hour flying time overhaul. Picked up from

					encountered a large force of enemy fighters beginning near Antwerp, Belgium and continuing until out
					at sea on the way home. Intense and very accurate flak was experienced over the target; along the
					route to/from the target flak was meagre and inaccurate. After the rally, the formation was south of
					course and struck by accurate, light flak near Hamm. A large force of enemy fighters came up to
					attack as the formation was nearing the enemy coast on the way home. Battle damaged on a mission to
					a Luftwaffe airfield at Evere, Brussels, Belgium 15Aug43. Weather over the Belgian coast was
					overcast and the formation headed for the Luftwaffe airfield at Vlissingen, Netherlands. Moderate,
					accurate flak was experienced over target area. Battle damaged on a mission to a roller bearing

					3/4Oct43 (5KIA:5POW). The plane developed engine problems before takeoff and departed about ½ hour
					late. The bomber completed its bomb run over the target and was then caught by searchlights. The
					pilot dove down to escape the lights which suddenly extinguished. That was when a German fighter
					came in to attack the bomber and started a small fire in the wing between no.3 and no.4 engines. The
					pilot dove down again and evidence of the fire disappeared. The plane had also been hit below the
					cockpit and started a fire. Cannon fire raked the fuselage killing a gunner. A Fw 190 had attacked
					from below; its tail was shot off by a gunner and as the pilot lost control of his fighter it came
					up and sideswiped the bomber beneath the radio room. By now the whole of the right wing was on fire.
					Some of the crew managed to bail out before the aircraft crashed on fire at Groß-Karben, ten miles
					northeast of Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

					the final stages, fighters from coastal airfields joined in the attacks. Damaged by flak with three
					0.30 calibre bullet holes in bottom of left wing; four holes in left wing, damaging main fuel tanks
					and 'Tokyo' fuel tanks; one 20mm cannon shell hole through right wing damaging fuel tank and wing
					spar; other flak damage throughout aircraft. Battle damaged on a mission to the port area at Bremen,

					return from a mission to the Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 31Dec43 (10RMC). With
					the primary target obscured by cloud, the formation headed for the secondary target, a Luftwaffe
					airfield at Châteaubernard, Cognac, France. Flak over the target was accurate and intense. Enemy
					fighters were picking on stragglers back to within thirty miles of the English coast. With one
					engine smoking and surviving a fighter attack over the Brest peninsular, short of fuel and alone,
					the pilot desperately looked for some place to land. The bomber was too low for the crew to bail out
					and, expecting to ditch, all except the two pilots took up their crash positions. The bomber managed

					the combat wing encountered a large force of enemy fighters beginning near Antwerp, Belgium and
					continuing on the way home. Intense and very accurate flak was experienced over the target; along
					the route to/from the target flak was meagre and inaccurate. Flak over the target disabled no.3
					engine and the bottom of no.2 fuel tank. Soon afterwards, no.2 propeller was feathered and believed
					this was due to loss of fuel supply. The aircraft stayed slightly below the formation until near
					Münster at which time fighters made heavy attacks on the crippled bomber. After using evasive action
					it was seen to slide off to the right of the formation and head for the clouds below, about five
					enemy fighters following. During this action, two enemy fighters were shot down by the crew aboard
					the bomber. Since most of the controls were shot away, three engines gone, radio gone, out of
					ammunition for the 0.50 calibre machine guns, oxygen supply in the rear gone, near 25-30 fighters on
					it, and inside of cockpit windows covered with black smoke so the windows had to be opened in order
					to see out, the pilot had no chance to contact the crew. The aircraft crash landed near Groot
					Schuylenburg on Zutphensestraat, Apeldoorn, Netherlands. {>1 missions}. Claimed by Major Wilhelm-

					moderate and accurate flak was coming from the centre of the target and the lead bombardier was

					heading into the sun causing the bombers to drop their bombs haphazardly, none hitting the target.
					By this time other groups were heading home along with their fighter escort. The plane had made a
					second run on the target, dropped its bombs and turned on course to England. The formation met
					attacks by several enemy fighters and during an attack the aircraft was hit by 20mm cannon fire.
					No.3 fuel tank and then the entire inboard sector of the right wing were on fire. The aircraft was

					the Group encountered strong enemy fighter attacks on the way home. Battle damaged on an Operation
					Gomorrah mission to the Klöckner Flugmotorenbau aero engine factory, Moorfleet, Hamburg, Germany
					25Jul43. Enemy fighter opposition was strong with attacks from the enemy coast to the target and
					back out to the coast. Flak was experienced from Cuxhaven to the target; over the target flak was
					intense and accurate. Failed to return from an Operation Gomorrah mission to the Blohm & Voss
					shipyard, Hamburg, Germany 26Jul43 (10RMC). The plane was a spare to fill in any position aborted by
					one of the group's planes. It was somewhat the worse for wear and tear in combat and reported to be
					an oil burner. There was some confusion among the groups in formation assembly at altitude, but none
					of the 91st planes appeared to have aborted and the pilot followed the formation to the coast line.
					He spotted a vacant slot in another group and filled the position before reaching the enemy coast.
					A smoke screen and intense flak was experienced over Hamburg; there was no fighter opposition. Going
					in to the target there was some enemy fighter action behind and a heavy flak barrage over the target.
					When it reached the North Sea the crew was startled to hear the pilot say prepare for ditching soon
					after they left the coast. It had not been possible to switch fuel tanks and the tanks were empty.
					There was a jolt as the ball turret hit the water first. The plane bounced up and came down again.
					The bomber was ditched in the North Sea forty miles off Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. The dinghy releases
					were pulled and the two of them popped out on the wings. The crew pushed the inflated dinghies to
					the end of each wing and hopped in, five in each, and shoved off. Fortunately the sea was fairly
					calm and the weather was clear and mild but the water was cold. Within a few minutes the plane had
					sunk enough so that the stabilizer was below the water surface. The fuselage had been damaged when
					the ball turret hit the water and caused the plane to break in two at the mid-section. then the
					plane sank forward as it broke in the middle. The radio operator had sent out May-Day signals before
					they ditched. Rescue was not long in coming, At first, two Spitfires buzzed and kept circling. Then
					a converted Lockheed Hudson bomber appeared, made a large circle and dropped a large dinghy. Shortly
					afterwards two Royal Air Force Air-Sea Rescue Supermarine Walrus amphibious aircraft landed and each
					one taxyed up to the dinghies. Five of the crew loaded into RAF Walrus L2307 and took off, five got
					into the second Walrus K8549 and prepared to takeoff, but by then the wind had picked up. The pilot
					made a take-off run but was sadly over-loaded and despite valiant efforts by the RAF pilot could not
					get airborne in the choppy sea. The plane bounced along and finally hit into a jolting wave that
					broke the tail stabilizer, There was nothing left to do but taxi towards England, about forty miles
					from their position, and hope for the best. Just before dark an Air-Sea Rescue launch found them,
					and with the damaged Walrus taxying behind, proceeded to port at Yarmouth, arriving about midnight.

					the clouds completely obscured the target; as a result, the Group did not make a bomb run. There
					were some fighter attacks by a flight of Fw 190s; the plane had no.4 engine shot out in a fighter
					attack. The pilot was having difficulty maintaining formation, fired a green flare and friendly
					fighters gave close support for the remainder of the return to the English coast. 0.30 calibre

					which were fair for height and good for deflection, and over the target itself, where the moderate
					bursts were accurate both as to height and deflection. Battle damaged on a mission to attack the
					submarine supply ship 'Kertosono' moored at Nantes, France 23Sep43. Moderate and accurate flak over
					the target; a large force of enemy fighters was encountered to and from the target. One 20mm cannon
					shell exploded above landing light top of left wing, wing spar damaged, gasoline lines and vacuum

					a mission to the Arado Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory, Anklam, Prussia 9Oct43. The formation was
					attacked by a large force of Luftwaffe fighters firing rockets soon after it crossed the Danish
					coast. They followed all the way in, attacking on the bomb run and over the target. Flak was meagre
					and inaccurate. The formation turned for home and flew straight into the Luftwaffe's assembled
					forces. The fighter attacks persisted for some three and a half-hours after leaving the target. In
					the final stages, fighters from coastal airfields joined in the attacks. One 20mm cannon shell hole
					in right elevator; one 0.30 calibre hole in right outboard wing panel, damaging the fuel tanks;
					three flak holes left side of vertical stabilizer; twenty flak holes right side of vertical
					stabilizer. Battle damaged on a mission to ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43.
					En route to the target area, the bomber formation was repeatedly attacked by a large number of
					Luftwaffe fighters; moderate to intense flak was reported over the target. After the target, the
					Group turned and headed westward for England; moderate flak was encountered at various places
					during the return home. German fighters, having landed and refuelled, attacked again until, finally,
					the bombers reached the coastline of western Europe and relative safety. On return, force landed at

					diverted to the secondary target, a Luftwaffe airfield at Châteaubernard, Cognac, France. Enemy
					fighters attacked off the French coast en route to the I.P.; flak at the target was moderate and
					accurate. Enemy fighters were picking on stragglers back to within thirty miles of the English
					coast. On return, force landed at RNAS Henstridge, Somerset. Flak tear in right wing outer panel

					encountered. There was heavy flak on the bomb run and light flak crossing the French coast. As the
					plane departed the enemy coast the pilot successfully feathered no.2 propeller but failed to
					feather no.1 which had started vibrating, necessitating a slower air speed. The pilot extended the

					(1KIA:9RMC). The formation was subject to continuous fighter attacks from the time it crossed over
					the enemy coast. In addition, the bombers were hit by flak as they passed over anti-aircraft defence
					zones. After the target, and before the formation could rendezvous with a P-47 Thunderbolt escort
					home, the squadron was subjected to further and continuous fighter attacks for about ninety minutes;
					a waist gunner was killed. Battle damaged during a mission to railway marshalling yards at Münster,
					Germany 10Oct43. Ground haze made visibility in the target area very poor. The 384th Bomb Group led
					the combat wing across the northern end of the Ruhr Valley over Hüls, subjecting the formation to
					the fire of approximately one hundred flak guns. The fire was extremely accurate for altitude and
					deflection; the lead Group took no evasive action. At the start of the bomb run, the lead bombardier
					observed a town burning and, mistaking it for the target, made the bomb run on it; the town was
					later identified as Coesfeld, Germany. Enemy fighters were observed but did not attack; the P-47
					Thunderbolt escort gave excellent protection and coverage. Battle damaged during a mission to a
					railway marshalling yard at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 5Nov43. Fighter opposition was weak but intense,
					heavy and accurate flak was encountered over the target. On the return journey, the combat wing
					leader took a course that led the formation near Antwerp, Belgium, and subjected the aircraft to
					severe flak defenses in that vicinity. Battle damaged on a mission to the city of Bremen, Germany
					26Nov43. Enemy fighter opposition was strong with attacks from the enemy coast to the target and
					back out to the coast. There was intense flak over Bremen but moderate and inaccurate elsewhere. A
					20mm cannon shell damaged a propeller and flak seriously damaged the fuselage nose section. Battle
					damaged on a mission to bomb a blockade runner ship 'Orsone' at the mouth of River Garonne, Gironde,
					France 31Dec43. Upon reaching the target area, it was found impossible to bomb because of complete
					cloud coverage; the Group had to abandon their primary target. It had been assigned to three
					alternate targets, so proceeded to fly to their first alternate. This target, too, proved to be
					completely covered with clouds, though they did receive a little attention in the form of flak. The
					Group then continued their aerial tour of France by going to the second alternate target; complete
					cloud coverage stopped them from bombing, though it received a few bursts of flak. The third target
					was no different; therefore it was necessary to return to base with their load of bombs. Failed to
					return from a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 fighter factory at Oschersleben, Germany
					11Jan44 (7KIA:3POW). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and
					a recall signal was issued. Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb
					Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy
					fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration. It
					proved to be the most disastrous of the 303rd Bomb Group combat missions flown to date; the 303rd
					lost eleven of the forty B-17s flying the mission. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer.
					Attacked by enemy fighters and exploded, crashing at Kloster Oesede, southeast of Osnabrück, Germany.

					VIII Bomber Command, England. 511th Bomb Squadron [DS*P], 351st Bomb Group, Polebrook (Station 110),
					Northamptonshire 6May43. {first combat mission 15May43}. Damaged on a mission to the submarine yards
					at Wilhelmshaven, Germany 21May43. During assembly over the North Sea, the pilot experienced a minor
					problem with the propeller governor on no.2 engine which caused difficulty in keeping the aircraft
					in close formation, but was insufficient to break formation. At a point near the Frisian Islands and
					at an altitude in excess of 20,000 feet, the no.2 propeller oversped; the pilot's efforts to feather
					the propeller were unsuccessful. A decision was made to abort the mission and attempt to return to
					base with the no.2 propeller wind milling out of control. The vibration from the wind milling
					propeller would increase during the descent causing the pilots to pull the aircraft up into a semi-
					stall position. This reduced the flying speed to about 125 mph, slowed the wind milling propeller
					and lessened the vibration. As the aircraft seemed to survive the continuous engine vibration, hope
					of reaching England without ditching emerged from the crew. However, observation of the engine from
					the nose section of the aircraft indicated that the reduction gear housing between the engine and
					the propeller showed metal discoloration caused by extreme heat; this indicated the possibility that
					the housing might disintegrate. Rivets around the engine cowling and the wing sections adjacent to
					the engine were observed to be popped. Upon reaching the English coast, with the aircraft under
					reasonable control but the propeller wind milling and engine vibration continuing, a new crisis was
					created when the planetary gears in the reduction gear assembly apparently seized and disintegrated;
					this caused the shaft between the engine and the propeller to shear. Only the force of air against
					the wind-milling propeller held the propeller from falling off the engine. The possibility of such a
					separation occurring became obvious when the aircraft was flown in a slight nose down attitude in
					that the pilot could see the wind milling propeller and propeller shaft move forward away from the
					engine. By bringing the nose of the aircraft to a slightly nose up attitude, the propeller and shaft
					would settle back into what appeared to be a more normal position. The aircraft landed safely at
					Polebrook, except that during the landing roll the propeller and shaft from the number two engine
					fell off about 200 yards after touchdown. One or more propeller blades struck the 0.50 calibre
					machine gun mounted in the left nose section of the aircraft, causing the gun to strike the
					navigator who was in the nose during the landing. The propeller striking the gun, rather than
					slicing through the nose section of the aircraft probably prevented serious injury to the navigator
					who was unhurt, although the gun was destroyed. The propeller did, however, cause extensive skin and
					structural damage to the bomber as it ran over the propeller that had dropped from the no.2 engine
					during the landing roll. Inspection of the aircraft after landing revealed extensive skin and
					structural damage to the left wing, fuselage, and no.2 engine nacelle. The engine was heavily
					damaged probably as the result of a fragment of the propeller governor entering the reduction gear
					assembly, disintegration of the gear assembly, and subsequent failure and disintegration of the gear
					housing and shearing the propeller shaft. Battle damaged on a mission to the port facilities at
					Nantes, France 16Sep43. The primary target was obscured by smoke and a target of opportunity, the
					railway marshalling yards on the Gare de l'Etat, Nantes, was selected. There was moderate and
					accurate flak from Rennes but at Nantes the flak was meagre and inaccurate; a large force of enemy
					fighters was encountered over Rennes. 2nd Strategic Air Depot, Little Staughton (Station 127),
					Bedfordshire 2Oct43. Regained by Group 5Oct43. Battle damaged on a mission to the Vereinigte
					Kugellagerfabriken AG (VKF) ball bearing works at Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43. En route to the
					target area, the bomber formation was repeatedly attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters.
					Flak in the target area was moderate in intensity and fair for accuracy. After the target, German
					fighters, having landed and refuelled, attacked again. One 20mm cannon shell hole through tip of
					right horizontal stabilizer; 0.50 calibre bullet hole in sill of right waist window; four small flak
					holes in skin of rudder right side. Battle damaged on a mission to the port area at Wilhelmshaven,
					Germany 3Nov43. Moderate, inaccurate flak was encountered over the target. Escort fighters were
					scheduled to cover the whole route over enemy territory but were not on hand for approximately ten
					minutes between the I.P. and the target, during which time the Group was attacked by enemy fighters.
					Battle damaged on a mission to railway marshalling yards at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 5Nov43. Fighter
					opposition was weak but intense, heavy and accurate flak was encountered over the target. Battle
					damaged on a mission to the port area of Bremen, Germany 26Nov43. Enemy fighter opposition was
					slight; flak was accurate and moderate in the target area, dispersed areas over the continent and
					outlying islands. On return, landed at RAF Warboys, Huntingdonshire. Battle damaged on a mission to
					the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft shipyard at Kiel, Germany 4Jan44. No enemy fighter opposition was
					encountered; flak was meagre and inaccurate. Battle damaged on a mission to the Kriegsmarinewerft
					shipyard at Wilhelmshaven, Germany 3Feb44. There was no enemy fighter opposition; flak was light and
					accurate over the target. Failed to return from an Operation Argument mission to the FAG
					Kugelfischer Georg Schäfer ball bearing factory at Schweinfurt, Germany 24Feb44 (10POW). Because of
					a very heavy pall of dark smoke caused by the bombing from previous combat wings, this Group bombed
					the Deutsche Star works in the southwest corner of the general target area. A few fighter attacks
					were experienced and flak at the target was moderate; other flak areas to and from the target were
					avoided. Damaged by flak and enemy fighters, no.3 engine was hit and lost oil pressure preventing
					the propeller from being feathered. After dropping bombs on the target, the bomb bay doors would not
					close. Drag was slowing the aircraft and falling behind the rest of the group. Attacked by two
					Bf 109s, a fire started in no.2 engine. A steep dive extinguished the fire and the bomber could
					maintain airspeed but was now very low. Part of the crew bailed out. Having passed over the
					IJsselmeer, flak damaged the remaining three engines. The bomber was crash landed in a field at the
					Kromme Spieringweg between the village of Vijfhuizen and Schiphol airfield, south of Amsterdam,
					Netherlands, stopping nose down in a drainage ditch. {31 missions}. EIGHT BALL. A propeller came
					off erasing the EIGHT on a flight 21May43; repaired and thereafter known as NO BALLS AT ALL. Named

					Squadron [RQ*P], 351st Bomb Group, Polebrook (Station 110), Northamptonshire 6May43. {first combat
					mission 14May43}. Accident during a mission to the Deutsche Werke Kiel AG shipyard at Kiel, Germany
					19May43 (1INJ). Fighter opposition was first encountered just before reaching the Danish peninsular
					and continued to the target. Light flak was encountered in the target area. The tail gunner passed
					out from lack of oxygen and suffered frostbite. Battle damaged on a mission to lock gates in the
					port of Saint-Nazaire, France 29May43. The pilot turned back twenty miles short of the French coast
					on course for the target because of a malfunction in the right waist gun, in which the right
					horizontal stabilizer and elevator were damaged while the gunner was attempting to clear the gun.
					Battle damaged on a mission to the Continental Gummiwerke A.G. synthetic rubber works at Nordhafen,
					Hannover, Germany 17Jul43. Weather caused the mission to be recalled before reaching the primary
					target. A few breaks in the clouds were occurring; the formation bombed a small, unidentified,
					village. Enemy fighter opposition began in the vicinity of the IJsselmeer after the formation turned
					back over Germany; it soon became determined and heavy, continuing to within sight of the English
					coast. Only a small amount of flak was encountered passing IJmuiden, Netherlands. Returning to base,
					the plane was damaged in an attack by enemy fighters near the Dutch coast. Enemy fighter attacks
					continued to within sight of the English coast. Hole in left aileron caused by empty shell casings;
					hole top of left horizontal stabilizer caused by shell cases; hole in leading edge of right
					horizontal stabilizer caused by shell cases; hole both sides of no.3 engine caused by shell cases;
					0.30 calibre hole on top of right wing outboard panel. Battle damaged on a mission to the Gerhard
					Fieseler Werke (GFW) aircraft factory at Waldau, Kassel, Germany 30Jul43. En route the combat wing
					encountered a large force of enemy fighters beginning near Antwerp, Belgium and continuing until out
					at sea on the way home. Intense and very accurate flak was experienced over the target; along the
					route to/from the target flak was meagre and inaccurate. After the rally, the formation was south of
					course and struck by accurate, light flak near Hamm. A large force of enemy fighters came up to
					attack as the formation was nearing the enemy coast on the way home. On return with fuel exhaustion,
					force landed at Boxted (Station 150), Essex. Battle damaged on a mission to the Arado Flugzeugwerke
					aircraft factory, Anklam, Prussia 9Oct43. The formation was attacked by a large force of Luftwaffe
					fighters firing rockets soon after it crossed the Danish coast. They followed all the way in,
					attacking on the bomb run and over the target. Flak was meagre and inaccurate. The formation turned
					for home and flew straight into the Luftwaffe's assembled forces. The fighter attacks persisted for
					some three and a half-hours after leaving the target. In the final stages, fighters from coastal
					airfields joined in the attacks. One 20mm cannon shell hole in right horizontal stabilizer; one flak
					hole in left elevator; two 20mm cannon shell holes in left side of fuselage on each side of waist
					window; one 13.9mm hole top of left wing; five 0.30 calibre holes in left side of fuselage at
					pilot's compartment; one 20mm cannon shell hole in no.2 engine nacelle; one 20mm cannon shell hole
					in no.4 propeller; one flak hole in left side of dorsal fin; one 20mm cannon shell hole in left side
					of vertical stabilizer. Battle damaged on a mission to railway marshalling yards at Gelsenkirchen,
					Germany 5Nov43. Fighter opposition was weak but intense, heavy and accurate flak was encountered over
					the target. Battle damaged on a mission to the port area of Bremen, Germany 26Nov43. Enemy fighter
					opposition was slight; flak was accurate and moderate in the target area, dispersed areas over the
					continent and outlying islands. Flak made a large hole in the rudder which necessitated replacement.
					Failed to return from a mission to the Rudolf Rautenbach aero engine casting foundry at Solingen,
					Germany 1Dec43 (3MIA:4KIA:3RMC). A force of enemy fighters was encountered in the vicinity of the
					Initial Point where the friendly fighter escort turned back; flak was intense and accurate. The
					plane ran into trouble over the target when no.3 engine failed. The bombardier jettisoned the bombs,
					but those in the left-hand rack did not fall. Then no.4 engine failed and the propeller could not be
					feathered. Immediately the plane dropped out of formation and began to lose height rapidly. A waist
					and ball turret gunners went into the bomb bay to try to release the bombs. While they were
					struggling to free the bombs, an enemy Bf 110 and a Ju 88 made a single pass at the bomber, riddling
					the wings with cannon fire. By the time the two gunners had released the bombs, half an hour had
					passed and the Fortress was down to 4,200 feet. Relieved of the weight of the bombs, the pilot was
					able to pull the plane up to 5,000 feet. Then a Bf 110 roared in from the right and his guns cut a
					line along the fuselage. Shell fragments struck and wounded the other waist gunner. The bomber
					limped on towards the coast, sneaking into the clouds to hide every time it passed over a city. Not
					far from the French coast, the plane rode through thick flak but survived. The gunners, preparing to
					ditch, threw everything they could overboard, ammunition, flak suits, guns, and radio equipment.
					Near Dunkerque, after the last of the ammunition had gone over the side, the tail gunner caught
					sight of a Bf 109 fighter taking off from an airfield below. The fighter came up, circled the bomber
					a couple of times, and then disappeared; apparently the pilot realized that the bomber could never
					struggle back to England. By this time the plane was practically at water level and most of the crew
					had assembled in the radio room for ditching. One of the two good engines started to sputter. When
					the pilot tilted the wings, the engine would roar normally for a brief interval, then choke and die
					again. However, the pilot managed to coax the plane five miles beyond the French coast before
					ditching. The plane skimmed the water in a perfect landing; nobody was injured during the ditching
					and all the crew managed to climb into dinghies. The plane sank in two minutes, five miles off
					Dunkerque, France. The ten men were divided into four dinghies. Because of rough seas and a strong
					wind, the small dinghy carrying three crew members drifted away from the others and are still
					missing. While drifting around, one crew member died from exposure and another became delirious.
					While continuing to drift in the Channel, two more crew members died from shock and exposure. Their
					bodies and the three remaining men were all picked up by a British Air-Sea Rescue launch ten miles
					off the French coast after seventy hours adrift in rough seas. {22 missions}. PATTY ANN II.

					to the Gnome et Rhône aero engine works at Le Mans, France 15Jun43. The weather was too bad to
					continue and the 103rd Combat Wing turned back towards England. On the return trip, the route went
					over Brest, France, as sparse but accurate flak was encountered. Battle damaged on a mission to the
					submarine base at Saint-Nazaire, France 28Jun43. En route to the target, after the friendly fighters
					had to return to base, the formation was attacked by a large force of enemy fighters. Flak was
					moderate but very accurate over the target. Enemy fighters attacked again on the route home off the
					Brest peninsula. On return, force landed at RAF Filton, Bristol. Battle damaged on a mission to a
					roller bearing factory at Schweinfurt, Germany 17Aug43. The formation was subject to continuous
					fighter attacks from the time it crossed over the enemy coast. In addition, the bombers were hit by
					flak as they passed over anti-aircraft defence zones. Flak hole in fuselage near nose; left waist
					window damaged by the waist gunner when firing his guns. Battle damaged on a mission to the center
					of the city of Frankfurt am Main, Germany 4Oct43. Flak over the target was moderate and accurate; a
					large force of enemy fighters was encountered, Bf 110 twin-engined fighters firing rockets from a
					distance beyond the range of the bombers' guns. On return, force landed at Ridgewell (Station 167),
					Essex. Battle damaged on a mission to the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft
					(Deschimag) shipyard at Bremen, Germany 8Oct43. Owing to difficulty with the Automatic Flight
					Control Equipment and misunderstanding on the interphone, the run on the primary target was missed.
					A run on the secondary target was impossible because of the approach of another bomb group,
					therefore, after reaching the rally point, a target of opportunity, the hangars at Quakenbrück was
					attacked. At the target, flak was accurate and intense; fighter opposition was mediocre and attacks
					were not pressed home. Battle damaged on a mission to the Rudolf Rautenbach aero engine casting
					foundry at Solingen, Germany 1Dec43. A force of enemy fighters was encountered in the vicinity of
					the Initial Point where the friendly fighter escort turned back; flak was intense and accurate. 2nd
					Strategic Air Depot, Little Staughton (Station 127), Bedfordshire 2Jan44. Regained by Group 21Jan44.
					Battle damaged on an Operation Argument mission to the FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schäfer ball bearing
					factory at Schweinfurt, Germany 24Feb44. Because of a very heavy pall of dark smoke caused by the
					bombing from previous combat wings, this Group bombed the Deutsche Star works in the southwest
					corner of the general target area. A few fighter attacks were experienced and flak at the target was
					moderate; other flak areas to and from the target were avoided. Small flak hole through fabric of
					right horizontal stabilizer; fabric torn from mount of left horizontal stabilizer caused by flak;
					hole in left wing inner panel near trailing edge behind no.2 engine nacelle, skin, corrugation and

					the Luftwaffe airfield at Glisy, Amiens, France 14Jul43. Fighter attacks on the Group were
					infrequent and not closely pressed home. Flak, however, while light, was extremely accurate from the
					target to Abbeville. Flak hole in cover of no.3 engine oil cooler; carburettor dented and hole in
					leading edge left wing outer panel; flak hole in left horizontal stabilizer leading edge. Battle
					damaged on a mission to the Continental Gummiwerke A.G. synthetic rubber works at Nordhafen,
					Hannover, Germany 17Jul43. Weather caused the mission to be recalled before reaching the primary
					target. A few breaks in the clouds were occurring; the formation bombed a small, unidentified,
					village. Enemy fighter opposition began in the vicinity of the IJsselmeer after the formation turned
					back over Germany; it soon became determined and heavy, continuing to within sight of the English
					coast. Only a small amount of flak was encountered passing IJmuiden, Netherlands. Returning to base,
					the plane was damaged in an attack by enemy fighters near the Dutch coast. Enemy fighter attacks
					continued to within sight of the English coast. Shell casing hole in right horizontal stabilizer
					leading edge; dent in no.2 engine ring cowling caused by an empty shell casing. Battle damaged on an
					Operation Gomorrah mission to the Klöckner Flugmotorenbau aero engine factory, Moorfleet, Hamburg,
					Germany 25Jul43. Because of a heavy smoke screen over Hamburg, it was necessary to bomb west of the
					briefed target, the Blohm & Voss aircraft works and ship yard. Heavy flak was experienced over
					Hamburg; there was weak enemy fighter opposition. Flak hole in Plexiglas nose; hole in leading edge
					of left wing caused by empty shell case; flak hole above co-pilot's window. Battle damaged on a
					mission to the Scholven AG synthetic fuel hydrogenation plant at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 12Aug43. A
					force of German fighters was sighted shortly after entering Germany and attacked the formation. The
					Lead Bombardier mistook the blast furnaces of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke at Bochum for the target at
					Gelsenkirchen. Flak at the target was heavy and accurate. The enemy fighters attacked again
					afterwards until the friendly fighter escort arrived. 2 inch flak hole leading edge of right wing,
					eight feet from tip; 2 inch tear top of right wing tip; 6 inch rip in skin of leading edge of wing
					between	no.3 and no.4 engines; 1 inch hole right side fuselage below #1 battery; 2 inch hole next to
					left landing light on leading edge; several small holes in left outboard wing panel; 1 inch rip
					above left waist window	hole in left horizontal stabilizer leading edge, near fuselage; 2 inch flak
					hole at rear edge of vertical stabilizer and through rudder; one foot rip in right horizontal
					stabilizer on top caused by the waist gunner when firing his guns. Failed to return from a mission
					to the Robert Bosch magneto factory at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43 (2INJ:8RMC). Enemy fighters were
					seen en route to the target but did not attack; flak was encountered most of the way in, becoming
					heavy approaching the target. The primary target was obscured by a heavy undercast; as a result, the
					railway marshalling yards in Offenburg were selected as a target of opportunity. Flak was meagre and
					inaccurate on the route in and out; a barrage was seen over the primary target. Twenty to thirty
					enemy fighters were seen but were hesitant in their attacks. With fuel exhaustion, the pilot ditched
					off Beachy Head, East Sussex; the crew swam ashore to safety. {14 missions}. FOUL BALL. Named in the
					tradition of 511th Bomb	Squadron by incorporating the word 'Ball' in the title, after the squadron's

					One flak hole, one-half inch in diameter, in a trim tab. Battle damaged on an Operation Gomorrah
					mission to the Klöckner Flugmotorenbau aero engine factory, Moorfleet, Hamburg, Germany 25Jul43.
					Because of a heavy smoke screen over Hamburg, it was necessary to bomb west of the briefed target,
					the Blohm & Voss aircraft works and ship yard. Heavy flak was experienced over Hamburg; there was
					weak enemy fighter opposition. Small flak holes in right aileron; two small breaks top of right wing
					caused by flak; the left elevator was damaged by the waist gunner when firing his guns. Battle
					damaged on a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield and air depot at Le Bourget, Paris, France 16Aug43.
					Enemy fighters were seen, although they stayed with the formation for only a short time; some flak
					was encountered, but it was only moderate in intensity. Battle damaged on a mission to the port
					facilities at Nantes, France 16Sep43. The primary target was obscured by smoke and a target of
					opportunity, the railway marshalling yards on the Gare de l'Etat, Nantes, was selected. There was
					moderate and accurate flak from Rennes but at Nantes the flak was meagre and inaccurate; a large
					force of enemy fighters was encountered over Rennes. Failed to return from a mission to the Arado
					Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory, Anklam, Prussia 9Oct43 (1KIA:9POW). The formation crossed the North
					Sea at 4,000 feet and prior to climbing to bombing altitude, the fuel was cross-fed into the main
					tanks and the bomb bay tanks jettisoned. As this operation was being carried out fire broke out but
					the crew managed to extinguish the flames and the plane continued in formation. The formation was
					attacked by a large force of Luftwaffe fighters firing rockets soon after it crossed the Danish
					coast. They followed all the way in, attacking on the bomb run and over the target. Flak was meagre
					and inaccurate. The pilot was forced to jettison the bombs after the target when the bomb bay doors
					had to be hand-cranked open. The formation turned for home and flew straight into the Luftwaffe's
					assembled forces. Attacked by enemy fighters and crashed at Kappeln, near Schleswig, Germany.

					attacked after the friendly escort returned home near Roosendaal, Netherlands. Flak over Ostend,
					Belgium was intense and accurate and damaged the left wing. Battle damaged on a mission to the
					Caudron-Renault aircraft factory at Issy-les-Moulineaux, Paris, France 3Sep43. A large number of
					enemy fighters attacked but were ineffective en route to the target. Flak over the target was
					intense but inaccurate. Flak damaged the bomb bay doors. Battle damaged on a mission to the Norma
					Compagnie roller bearing factory at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43. The Group encountered an estimated
					forty enemy fighters. However, the German pilots made only cautious and inexpert attacks against the
					formation. Cloud cover over the target caused the Group to return home and bomb any target they
					could find. On the way back, the Group strayed from course and encountered considerable flak from
					numerous places which was moderate and accurate. Battle damaged on a mission to the Rudolf

					area very poor. The 384th Bomb Group led the combat wing across the northern end of the Ruhr Valley
					over Hüls, subjecting the formation to the fire of approximately one hundred flak guns. The fire was
					extremely accurate for altitude and deflection; the lead Group took no evasive action. At the start
					of the bomb run, the lead bombardier observed a town burning and, mistaking it for the target, made
					the bomb run on it; the town was later identified as Coesfeld, Germany. Enemy fighters were observed
					but did not attack; the P-47 Thunderbolt escort gave excellent protection and coverage. Battle
					damaged during a mission to the Vereinigte Kugellagerfabriken AG (VKF) ball bearing works at
					Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43. En route to the target area, the bomber formation was repeatedly
					attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters; moderate to intense flak was reported over the
					target. After the target, the Group turned and headed westward for England; moderate flak was
					encountered at various places during the return home. German fighters, having landed and refueled,
					attacked again until, finally, the bombers reached the coastline of western France and relative
					safety. On return, force landed at RAF Northolt, Middlesex. Battle damaged during a mission to

					encountered over most of the route to and from the target; there was no enemy fighter opposition.
					Battle damaged on a mission to railway marshalling yards at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 11Feb44.
					Moderate and accurate flak was encountered over and past the target; rockets fired from the ground
					were seen just after leaving the target, but went far above the formation with no explosions
					observed. A few enemy fighters were seen but kept at bay by the friendly escort. Battle damaged
					during a mission to industrial areas in the suburbs of Berlin, Germany 6Mar44. Weather conditions
					over the primary target were unfavourable and the formation concentrated on a secondary target at
					Templin, north of Berlin. Vicious enemy fighter attacks were experienced en route to the target
					after the escort had to turn back. Flak en route was moderate and accurate but intense and accurate
					over Berlin; rockets were fired from several locations. More fighters and flak were encountered over
					Magdeburg on the route home. Battle damaged on a mission to the FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schäfer ball
					bearing factory at Schweinfurt, Germany 13Apr44. Enemy fighters attacked before the target; moderate
					to intense and accurate flak was experienced over the target. Failed to return from a mission to
					targets in the city of Berlin, Germany 29Apr44 (8KIA:2POW). Flak was intense and accurate over the
					target. Enemy fighters were reported but did not attack the formation; attacks were concentrated on
					stragglers. The plane straggled en route to the target area and the pilot was attempting to catch up
					to the formation. It was attacked by enemy fighters just before the target. Flak struck the right
					wing between no.3 and no.4 engines on the trailing edge and started smoking. It then dropped back
					and was attacked by enemy fighters. Exploded and crashed in the Schwielowsee, west of Caputh,
					southwest of the Berlin to Potsdam road, Germany. {33 missions}. MAX.

					25Jun47; scrapped. YE OLDE PUB.	Charles Brown was a B-17 Flying Fortress pilot with the 379th Bomber
					Group at Kimbolton, England. His B-17 was called 'Ye Old Pub' and was in a terrible state, having
					been hit by flak and fighters during a mission to the port area at Bremen, Germany 20Dec43. The
					compass was damaged and they were flying deeper over enemy territory instead of heading home to
					Kimbolton. After flying over an enemy airfield, a Luftwaffe pilot named Franz Steigler was ordered
					to takeoff and shoot down the B-17. When he got near the B-17, he could not believe his eyes. In his
					words, he 'had never seen a plane in such a bad state'. The tail and rear section was severely
					damaged, and the tail gunner wounded. The top gunner was all over the top of the fuselage. The nose
					was smashed and there were holes everywhere. Despite having ammunition, Franz flew to the side of
					the B-17 and looked at Charlie Brown, the pilot. Brown was scared and struggling to control his
					damaged and blood-stained plane. Aware that they had no idea where they were going, Franz waved at
					Charlie to turn 180 degrees. Franz escorted and guided the stricken plane to and slightly over the
					North Sea towards England. He then saluted Charlie Brown and turned away, back to Europe. When Franz
					landed he told his CO that the plane had been shot down over the sea, and never told the truth to
					anybody. Charlie Brown and the remains of his crew told all at their briefing, but were ordered
					never to talk about it. More than 40 years later, Charlie Brown wanted to find the Luftwaffe pilot
					who saved the crew. After years of research, Franz was found. He had never talked about the incident,
					not even at post-war reunions. They met in the USA at a 379th Bomber Group reunion, together with
					five people who are alive now - all because Franz never fired his guns that day. Research shows that
					Charlie Brown lived in Seattle, WA and Franz Steigler had moved to Vancouver, BC after the war. When
					they finally met, they discovered they had lived less than 200 miles apart for the past 50 years!

					final seconds of the bomb run, a German fighter swooped down unnoticed from the sun. One 20mm cannon
					shell hit the pilot in the neck, exploded and killed him. A fire started in the cockpit, badly
					burning the co-pilot's hands. A crewmate put out the fire with an extinguisher. The co-pilot
					continued flying with a melted oxygen mask, steering with his arms above the elbows, since his hands
					were too badly burned. The bombardier bailed out when he heard the alarm bell sounding. Still under
					attack, a machine gun bullet hit the box of flares behind the pilot's seat. The flares exploded,
					created another fire and blew open the bomb bay doors. Fortunately, there was a third pilot on board,
					the usual co-pilot, who was acting as a waist gunner that day. He took over the co-pilot seat. With

					fighter factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44. Enemy fighter attacks were very numerous; flak was
					moderate but accurate due to the low altitude of the mission. Battle damaged on an Operation
					Argument mission to the Erla Maschinenwerk Bf 109 aircraft factory at Mockau, Leipzig, Germany
					20Feb44. Cloud cover hid the target and the Group diverted to an alternate target, the industrial
					areas of Oschersleben, Germany. Flak was moderate but accurate over the target. On the homebound leg,
					northwest of Stavelot, Belgium, the aircraft was attacked by a number of enemy fighters. It had
					seventy-five holes in it; one large piece of flak struck right outside the co-pilot's window and
					tore a long hole in the window frame. Another piece went through the dinghies. There were a couple of
					20mm holes in the horizontal stabilizer; they didn't explode. The right wing was peppered with 7.9mm
					bullets and holes in two of the propellers. Sent to the Sub- Depot for repairs. There were thirty-
					six bullet holes in the right wing, some just missing the supercharger; the main spars had been cut.
					Twelve slugs were removed from the gasoline tank. {91BG: 12 missions}. Base Air Depot No.1,

					The plane had dropped its bomb load on the target and was returning home when the right wing was
					struck by flak behind no.3 engine and the escaping fuel caught fire. The aircraft went into a spiral
					dive and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea 40km northwest of the island of Marettimo, Sicily,
					exploding as it hit the water. Three airmen were seen to bail out by another crew who followed the
					disabled aircraft in its downward path and threw several life vests into the sea where the men had
					bailed out. They also threw a life raft out of the aircraft but it unfortunately caught in the right
					horizontal stabilizer. After a short time the pilot was forced to gain altitude and the men and
					aircraft disappeared from view. THUNDERBIRD.

					it crossed over the enemy coast. In addition, the bombers were hit by flak as they passed over anti-
					aircraft defence zones. During the bomb run the lead bombardier in this plane was seriously wounded
					by flak and not able to sight the target; the navigator salvoed the bombs a little late. Failed to
					return from a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Gilze-Rijen, Netherlands 19Aug43 (4KIA:7POW). With
					haze prior to the Initial Point, over the target moderate and accurate flak was coming from the
					center of the target and the lead bombardier was unable synchronize the bomb sight. Going round for
					another run over the target, the formation was heading into the sun causing the bombers to drop
					their bombs haphazardly, none hitting the target. By this time other groups were heading home along
					with their fighter escort. The formation was then attacked by a small force of enemy fighters.
					Leading the squadron, attacked by several Fw 190s, the plane was hit and a fire started in no.3

					number of Luftwaffe fighters; moderate to intense flak was reported over the target. After the
					target, the Group turned and headed westward for England; moderate flak was encountered at various
					places during the return home. German fighters, having landed and refuelled, attacked again.
					Departing late, approaching the river Rhine, the four-plane high squadron of the 305th Bomb Group
					was still trying to catch up with the lead squadron. Several enemy fighters came at the B-17s and
					attacked. The bomber lost power on one engine and the pilot was having trouble controlling it; the

					on a tactical mission to the Luftwaffe airfield at Glisy, Amiens, France 14Jul43 910RMC). Fighter
					attacks on the Group were infrequent and not closely pressed home. Flak, however, while light, was
					extremely accurate from the target to Abbeville. After dropping its bombs the plane came under
					attack by a flight of Fw 190 fighters. In the nose the bombardier returned fire on one of the
					fighters, apparently killing the pilot. Out of control, the enemy fighter smashed into the bomber's
					right wing between the inner engine and the fuselage, knocking off the no.3 propeller. The engine
					and propeller came free and departed over the top of no.4 engine, cutting a deep gash in the nacelle
					top which immediately poured forth a black stream of oil into the air. The rest continued on over
					the wing, doubled up the right waist guns, the impact knocking the gunner to the floor, and sliced
					into the right horizontal stabilizer before falling away. Pieces of metal from the Focke-Wulf tore
					through the fuselage, and a gun barrel buried itself in the wall between the radio room and the bomb
					bay. Knocked out of formation by the impact, in a deep stall and apparently out of control, the
					pilots struggled in the cockpit and somehow managed to bring their bomber back under control. Acting
					on reflex, the two pilots rammed the control yokes forward to their full extent and pushed the
					throttles forward for maximum power. As their group began to fade into the distance and the bomber
					was letting down at 500 feet a minute to maintain flying speed, the navigator reported that all was
					okay and that the nearest airfield was Manston, Kent. The pilots could see the English Channel when
					the plane flew over a flak battery; it received a number of hits, none direct (the crew later
					counted over 1,000 holes in T.S.). The crew fought off a subsequent attack on the tail by more
					Fw 190s; a 20mm cannon shell exploded under the pilot's seat. Escorted by P-47 Thunderbolts to keep
					off any more marauding enemy fighters, the badly damaged bomber made a smooth crash landing at the
					emergency landing field, RAF Manston, Kent, UK. Not one crew member was injured. {>4 missions}.

					continued until the formation departed the French coast on return home; accurate flak was
					encountered on leaving the target. Battle damaged on a mission to the Scholven AG synthetic fuel
					hydrogenation plant at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 12Aug43. The bombers had made a good run on the target
					with evasive action, dodging the most intense flak yet encountered. Formation problems prevented
					dropping bombs on the primary target; unidentified military installations were bombed leaving the
					primary target area. Heavy fighter attacks occurred for over an hour after leaving the target and
					only broke off when the friendly P-47 Thunderbolt fighters appeared. Scattered flak was encountered
					at different stages of the journey, but the Ruhr valley barrages were intense and accurate. Battle
					damaged on a mission to Luftwaffe airfields at Poix-de-Picardie and Glisy, Amiens, France 15Aug43.
					The Group split their bomb load and attacked both targets. Meagre to moderate, intense and accurate
					flak was encountered in the target area. No enemy fighters were seen and the Spitfire escort was
					excellent. Battle damaged on a mission to the Luftwaffe airfield and air depot at Le Bourget, Paris,
					France 16Aug43. Enemy fighters were seen, although they stayed with the formation for only a short
					time; some flak was encountered, but it was only moderate in intensity. Gee-H radio navigation

					River at Nantes, France 16Sep43. The ship was not found in the briefed area, so the Group attacked
					the secondary target, port facilities and shipping. There was moderate and accurate flak from Rennes
					but at Nantes the flak was moderate and inaccurate. A large force of enemy fighters was encountered.
					Battle damaged during the first Eighth Air Force operational use of Pathfinder aircraft on a mission
					to the port area at Emden, Germany 27Sep43. Clouds obscured the primary target forcing the wing
					leader to seek a target of opportunity, the city of Aurich, northeast of Emden. A force of enemy
					fighters was encountered in the target area but attacks were not pressed home; flak over the target
					area was meagre and inaccurate. One engine failed before reaching the target, no.2 engine was struck
					by flak. A third engine failed on the way home. The crew threw as much as possible overboard to
					reduce weight and the pilot was able to bring the plane back to base on one engine. Battle damaged
					on a mission to the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft (Deschimag) shipyard at
					Bremen, Germany 8Oct43. The effectiveness of a smoke screen, in combination with a haze that
					extended to altitude, caused the Group to attack the secondary target, the city of Bremen. The
					formation was met with stiff resistance by German fighters the entire way, from the Dutch coast all
					the way to the target and back again. Over the Initial Point and the target, the Group encountered i
					ntense flak. Failed to return from a mission to the Vereinigte Kugellagerfabriken AG (VKF) ball
					bearing works at Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43 (7KIA:3EVD). En route to the target area, the bomber
					formation was repeatedly attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters; moderate to intense flak
					was reported over the target. After the target, the Group turned and headed westward for England;
					moderate flak was encountered at various places during the return home. German fighters, having
					landed and refuelled, attacked again. After the target all the guns failed. When enemy fighters
					attacked, the crew was unable to fight back. Damaged by the enemy fighters with the plane on fire
					and the pilot shot, the crew was unable to open the bomb bay or waist exits before the bomber
					exploded, blowing off the nose of the aircraft. The aircraft crashed and was destroyed by fire at
					Rambluzin-Meuse, 30km south of Verdun, France. {17 missions}. The JOKER.

					Nazaire, France 28Jun43. En route to the target, after the friendly fighters had to return to base,
					the formation was attacked by a large force of enemy fighters. Flak was moderate but very accurate
					over the target. Enemy fighters attacked again on the route home. A life raft broke loose and caught
					round the vertical stabilizer. The aircraft spiralled down, out of control. A crew member was able
					to tie the raft's lifelines to a waist gun, and using the gun as a lever, prised the raft loose and
					enabled the pilot to regain control of the aircraft. Not too soon as two German fighters swept in to
					attack the stricken aircraft, but they were both shot down and the bomber headed home. Failed to
					return from a mission to the Nordisk Aluminium A/S works at Herøya, Norway 24Jul43 (10INT). There
					was fairly accurate flak during the bomb run over the target. With a critical fuel load, the
					formation cut the route home by flying down near the coast of Norway. This attracted some more flak
					and a small force of enemy fighters which made a vigorous attack on the formation. Struck by flak
					disabling no.2 engine along with a hole in the left wing which had punctured a fuel tank and was
					leaking. No.3 engine was leaking oil and smoking. Realising that it couldn't make it back to England,
					the pilot turned the plane and headed for Sweden. Crash landed in a bog 2km south-southwest of
					Vännacka station, Sweden and crew interned. The crew was later freed. First US bomber to land in

					to bomb west of the briefed target, the Blohm & Voss aircraft works and ship yard. Heavy flak was
					experienced over Hamburg; there was weak enemy fighter opposition. Battle damaged on a mission to
					the Gerhard Fieseler Werke (GFW) aircraft factory at Bettenhausen Kassel, Germany 28Jul43. With
					heavy cloud cover over Germany, the mission was aborted. After turning back, there was a break in

					run on the target with evasive action, dodging the most intense flak yet encountered. Formation
					problems prevented dropping bombs on the primary target; unidentified military installations were
					bombed leaving the primary target area. Heavy fighter attacks occurred for over an hour after
					leaving the target and only broke off when the friendly P-47 Thunderbolt fighters appeared.
					Scattered flak was encountered at different stages of the journey, but the Ruhr valley barrages were
					intense and accurate. Failed to return from a mission to ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt,

					Netherlands, there was moderate and fairly accurate flak. As it approached the city, the formation
					was swarmed by a large force of enemy aircraft for an estimated forty-five minutes of vicious
					fighting. Intense and accurate flak was also encountered. When the lead plane was hit, the commander
					slowed and started to descend, taking the Group with him. However, this pilot recognised the danger
					of being exposed to the mass of Luftwaffe fighters and climb to join another Group. Returning from
					the target, the aircraft was hit by flak in no.4 engine which caused the aircraft to fly in an
					uncontrollable right turn. The aircraft, too slow, joined a B-24 Liberator escorted by a P-47
					Thunderbolt. A frontal attack by a German Fw 190 fighter damaged the nose and put the plane into a
					spin at 20,000 feet. As it emerges from the spin at 10,000 feet, the pilot saw five parachutes

					formation faced strong opposition from enemy fighters en route from the Belgian coast, to the Alps
					and out over the Adriatic Sea; flak was sporadic and inaccurate. Enemy fighter aircraft had damaged
					the bomb bay during the bomb run. The pilot jettisoned the bombs and remained in the formation. The
					plane made it over the target, badly shot up and one engine out. After the target, the bomber turned
					south for North Africa. No.4 engine was disabled and no.3 engine was later destroyed in enemy
					attacks; the propeller was wind milling. The plane could not keep up with the formation. All alone
					the pilot tried for Switzerland but the crew was forced to bail out as soon as the plane cleared
					down to 3,500 feet over Milano, Italy. The crew bailed out safely and the aircraft crashed in
					mountains at Ghedi, twelve miles south of Brescia, Italy. FLAK HAPPY.

					day, the briefed mission was for the 5th Wing composed of the 2nd, 97th, 301st and 99th Bomb Groups,
					to fly on a southerly course through the heel of Italy to the town of Lecce where the Wing would
					then take a heading out over the Adriatic Sea, to a point over the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece.
					From this point the crews were briefed to complete a 90° degree turn to the Initial Point over
					Lagousa Island. From there the mission dictated a straight run in to the target, reassemble, and
					return to base. After the formation was organized and began making its way to the target, the Groups
					ran into a weather front of 10/10 clouds. At eighteen thousand feet they entered an overcast. The
					clouds were very thick and visibility was not much beyond the wingtips, making it almost impossible
					to see other aircraft in the formation. At that altitude, and with the thickness of the clouds, ice
					began to form on their wings. In such situations it was standard operating procedure for trailing
					squadrons in the formation to fly off course for a couple minutes to obtain some spacing from the
					lead squadron, which would continue to maintain its course. However, as the 97th Bomb Group began
					making a left turn for their bomb run on the target, the lead plane of the 342nd Bomb Squadron
					encountered severe turbulence made by the preceding elements of the Wing. The turbulence was so
					severe that the lead aircraft of the squadron was forced into a steep left bank before it plummeted
					temporarily out of control and lost altitude at a rate of 1,000ft per minute. By the time the pilot
					was able to recover and regain his place in formation, the two sister planes in the flight were n
					owhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the pilots of the two sister planes from the flight, B-17F 42-3251 and
					B-17F 42-29918 found themselves alone in 10/10 visibility, unsure where the formation had
					disappeared to, with ice forming on their wings, and experiencing engine trouble. From what was
					deduced later in the accident report, the doomed B-17s made the decision to abort and turn back for
					the relative safety of Italy. In a tragic turn of events, their decision to return home took them
					directly into the path of the oncoming 301st Bomb Group. According to the official report of the
					Board of Inquiry, the two B-17s of the 97th Bomb Group experienced engine trouble and left the
					formation. Instead of making a 180-degree right turn, away from the formation, the aircraft made a
					turn to the left and flew head-on into the 301st formation. According to a Bombardier assigned to
					the lead ship of the 301st Bomb Group, and flown by the Group Commanding Officer, he was startled to
					see a pair of 97th Bomb Group B-17s emerge out of a cloud about 20 degrees to the left and aimed
					straight at his aircraft. Almost Instantly, both B-17s bracketed his aircraft, with one passing
					closely over his right wing that clipped the vertical stabilizer, and the other closely passing
					beneath the left wing. Almost immediately, the tail gunner witnessed a big ball of fire that lit up
					the clouds as the B-17s collided with one fortress in the lead element, and two B-17s in the second
					element. P-38 pilots, flying low cover escort under the overcast, reported watching pieces of B-17s
					raining from the sky for what seemed like five minutes. There were eight B-17s that fell out of the
					sky simultaneously. Thirteen Americans survived; 64 perished.

					Germany 25Jul43. Because of a heavy smoke screen over Hamburg, it was necessary to bomb west of the
					briefed target, the Blohm & Voss aircraft works and ship yard. Heavy flak was experienced over
					Hamburg; there was weak enemy fighter opposition. Battle damaged on a mission to the Gerhard
					Fieseler Werke (GFW) aircraft factory at Bettenhausen Kassel, Germany 28Jul43. With heavy cloud
					cover over Germany, the mission was aborted. After turning back, there was a break in the clouds and
					the formation was attacked by forty to fifty enemy aircraft of various types. Moderate, inaccurate
					flak was encountered en route. Battle damaged during a mission to the Scholven AG synthetic fuel
					hydrogenation plant at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 12Aug43 (1WIA:9RMC). The bombers had made a good run
					on the target with evasive action, dodging the most intense flak yet encountered. Formation problems
					prevented dropping bombs on the primary target; unidentified military installations were bombed
					leaving the primary target area. Heavy fighter attacks occurred for over an hour after leaving the
					target and only broke off when the friendly P-47 Thunderbolt fighters appeared. Scattered flak was
					encountered at different stages of the journey, but the Ruhr valley barrages were intense and
					accurate. No.1 and no.3 engines damaged by 20mm cannon shells and many flak holes in the plane;
					bombardier was wounded. On return, landed away at Framlingham (Station 153), Suffolk. Regained by

					Battle damaged on a mission to the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft (Deschimag)
					shipyard at Bremen, Germany 8Oct43. The effectiveness of a smoke screen, in combination with a haze
					that extended to altitude, caused the Group to attack the secondary target, the city of Bremen. The
					formation was met with stiff resistance by German fighters the entire way, from the Dutch coast all
					the way to the target and back again. Over the Initial Point and the target, the Group encountered
					intense flak. Battle damaged on a mission to the port area at Bremen, Germany 13Dec43 (1WIA:9RMC).
					Moderate to intense accurate flak was encountered over Den Helder at the Dutch coast; meagre,
					inaccurate flak was seen in the target area. The formation did not see any enemy fighters; fighter
					support was excellent. Navigator was wounded. Battle damaged on a mission to the I.G. Farben
					chemical works at Oppau, Ludwigshafen, Germany 30Dec43. Flak over the target was meagre and accurate.
					A small group of enemy fighters attacked the formation from the Initial Point, over the target and
					continued back to France. With no.4 engine shut down, the bomber returned to force land at RAF
					Gatwick, Surrey. 2nd Strategic Air Depot, Little Staughton (Station 127), Bedfordshire 31Dec43.

					damaged on an Operation Argument mission to the Erla Maschinenwerk Bf 109 aircraft factory at Mockau,
					Leipzig, Germany 20Feb44. A few enemy fighters were sighted but did not attack the Group. Flak at

					clouds and separated from the formation; it was ten miles to the left of the Group when enemy
					fighters attacked. No.4 engine was disabled and the ailerons damaged. Cannon shells riddled the
					radio room and started a fire, quickly extinguished by the radio operator. The crew fought back and
					claimed four enemy fighters shot down but not before the fighters scored more damage and wounded the
					tail gunner. The pilot was able to return to base and land safely. Accident on mission to the
					Klockner Flugmotorenbau aero engine factory at Hamburg, Germany 17Jul43 (4MIA:6RMC). Weather caused
					the mission to be recalled before reaching the target. The life raft hatch blew open, the life raft
					came out and became tangled with the vertical stabilizer of the plane. The plane was out of control
					for about ten minutes during which time four gunners bailed out over the North Sea, twenty-five
					miles from the German coast. The pilot subsequently recovered control and made it back to land
					safely at base. Failed to return from a mission to the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft shipyard at
					Kiel, Germany 13Dec43 (3KIA:7POW). Flak throughout the mission was meager to moderate but quite
					accurate. The formation did not encounter any enemy fighters; fighter support was excellent.
					Returning home, the PFF navigator found that the combat wing was forty miles south of course;
					checking back on the dead reckoning route, he found that Hamburg had been bombed instead of Kiel.

					Moderate to intense accurate flak was encountered at the target with meagre flak along the route.
					German fighters started a determined attack as soon as the bombers turned off the target. Over Texel,
					Harlingen, flak disabled an engine. The pilot turned back to the mainland, descending and, in an
					evasive action, collided with B-17F 42-30860; an engine was torn off the wing. Attacked and damaged
					further by an enemy fighter, the pilot ordered the crew to jump. First three airmen jumped over the
					Wadden Sea and are MIA, two landed on the coast and became POW, the remaining crew were killed when
					the bomber exploded. Wreckage crashed 1km southwest of Kimswerd, south of Harlingen, Netherlands.

					{first combat mission 25Jun43}. Failed to return from a mission to the submarine base at Saint-
					Nazaire, France 28Jun43 (10RMC). En route to the target, after the friendly fighters had to return
					to base, the formation was attacked by a large force of enemy fighters. Flak was moderate but very
					accurate over the target. Enemy fighters attacked again on the route home off the Brest peninsula.
					The bomber had the rudder control cables, landing gear and interphone system shot away by German
					fighter planes which had attacked the formation. Inside the plane, a shell had burst. The Fortress
					had begun to slip and lose altitude. In the mid-section, the radio operator and two waist gunners
					thought the ship too badly damaged to stay aloft. They sought instructions over the interphone,
					discovered it had been shot away, then bailed out. The ball turret gunner saw all three men leave
					the plane. Also unable to get a call through to the pilot over the interphone, he figured that the
					Fortress was being abandoned by the entire crew, but he took the precaution of crawling out of his
					turret to see if the pilot, co-pilot and tail-gunner were still aboard. Re-assured by the presence
					of the six remaining members of the crew, the gunner tried unsuccessfully to tie together the
					severed ends of the controls cables. He crawled back to his turret to find a Focke-Wulf 190
					approaching at 800 yards. He fired short bursts at it; at 200 yards the enemy plane turned over and
					plummeted downward in a trail of smoke. Then a second Focke-Wulf attacked the tail of the Fortress
					below. This time, the gunner started firing from 1,000 yards. The German drew closer, then started
					pouring black smoke, and then fell into a spin; the pilot bailed out. A third fighter streaked under
					the tail of the bomber; the fighter was shot down. Meanwhile, neither the pilot, nor co-pilot was
					aware that three of the crew had bailed out. They had been too busy on the bombing run under the
					hail of 20-millimeter cannon fire. To give the aircraft fire-power protection in every sector, the
					navigator went to the waist and manned one of the guns until the Germans were out distanced. By now
					the oxygen shortage was acute. The pilot and co-pilot were suffering from hypoxia. Nearing England,
					another menace developed; the fuel supply was running dangerously low. There wasn't enough to reach
					their base. The pilot decided to put the plane down on the first emergency field they could find.
					Then he found that the landing gear would not operate, that it would have to be a crash landing and
					ditched in Mount's Bay off Newlyn, Cornwall. The remaining crew were rescued. {2 missions}. Assigned
					to GLUE (Britain Zone II). Condemned 28Jul43. HARLEY CHARLEY.

					Because of a heavy smoke screen over Hamburg, it was necessary to bomb west of the briefed target,
					the Blohm & Voss aircraft works and ship yard. Heavy flak was experienced over Hamburg; there was
					weak enemy fighter opposition. The plane left formation after the target at the rally point,
					presumably hit by flak; the no.3 engine was smoking and the propeller was feathered. A 20mm cannon
					shell from a Fw 190 fighter entered the cockpit and hit the co-pilot which killed him instantly. The

					decided to remain in the turret and try to fake being OK by continuing to swing the turret. The tail

					coast. {6 missions}. 8th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Heavy) (Provisional), 802nd Reconnaissance
					Group, Watton (Station 376), Norfolk. Ditched off Ballyfortrum, near Dingle, County Kerry, Eire
					29May44 (8RMC). The aircraft was flown by the United States Army Air Forces Heavy Reconnaissance
					unit, the 25th Bomb Group. At this particular time the unit was known as the 802nd Reconnaissance
					Group and within that the aircraft and crew flew with the 8th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron
					(Heavy). They were based at Watton in Norfolk, but the large B-17's sometimes flew from the nearby
					airfield at North Pickenham (Station 143), Norfolk which had better runways. The flight began from
					the airfield at North Pickenham on the evening of May 28th, bound for the Atlantic on a weather
					observation mission with the operational profile code named 'Epicure'. The normal programme for such
					a flight was to fly from base to St. Eval and then head out over the Atlantic on a track of 260
					degrees from true north. Meteorological observations were to be made at a pressure level of 950
					millibars at fourteen numbered positions along that track, each fifty nautical miles apart. 950
					millibars does not always equate to the same height since sea level pressure and air temperatures
					vary a bit, it usually equals roughly 1,800 feet. At positions 4, 8, 12 and 14 the aircraft would
					also descend to measure sea level pressure usually from a height of 400 feet as recorded on the
					radio altimeter. Then it would climb quickly to 950 millibars again to make observations at that
					level. This mission however began to go wrong when the No 1 engine had to be feathered around
					midnight, forcing the crew to abandon the mission and return to base on three engines. Suddenly
					engine no.3 also began to give trouble and that too had to be feathered. They flew for two hours on
					the two remaining engines until the dark shadows of Ireland were made out. Knowing that there was
					high ground, the Captain elected for a ditching and the non flying crew members braced themselves
					into the radio compartment behind the bomb bay. Having ditched the aircraft, the crew then had to
					abandon the floating aircraft and take to the two life rafts built into the aircraft's spine. This
					was managed but only to reveal that one of the dinghies would not fully inflate. Four of the men
					struggled to shore and raised the alarm. Following the successful rescue of the men in the dinghy,
					all eight men were given food and shelter until the morning when they were returned to the UK.

					Enemy fighters were in the target area but attacked other formations with no attacks on this Group.
					Flak over the Target was moderate, low and to the left of the formation. After the target no.1
					engine leaked oil, the propeller could not be feathered and the plane dropped out of formation.
					Enemy fighters attacked damaging the plane with 20mm cannon shells. It went into a steep climb as

					fighters continued to attack. The bomber dropped down into some clouds at 3,000 feet and levelled
					off while the engineer was transferring fuel. A wing tip had been shot off and the top turret had
					been hit. Although continuing to attack, the bomber was not hit - the crew were fighting back. About
					one hour after leaving the target, the pilot spotted some B-17s and P-38 fighter and headed towards
					them. Thirty minutes later as the bomber neared the French coast, three enemy fighters came through
					a break in the clouds and attacked. A fighter scored a hit on the right wing and the bomber went
					into a dive. The crew prepared to bail out as the pilot pulled the plane out at 1,800 feet. No.3
					engine had stopped and no.4 engine was misfiring. Then the engineer reported the right wing on fire

					During the summer of 1943 at RAF St Eval, Padstow, Cornwall, no.1404 Meteorological Flight became
					no.517 Squadron and began re-equipping with the Handley-Page Halifax. Because of this no.517 was
					unable to maintain its operational commitment of twice-daily meteorological reconnaissance sorties
					to the southwest over Biscay (code-named EPICURE). Such was the importance of these flights that the
					USAAF offered four B-17s to make up the shortfall - adding another four aircraft later. Initially
					these were detached to RAF St Eval and operated to the west of the UK (code-named ALLAH), but during
					the autumn it was decided the USAAF aircraft should operate from an American base - Bovingdon
					(Station 112), Hertfordshire. As the USAAF didn't have aircrew trained in meteorological observing,
					the crews always flew with an RAF Meteorological Air Observer (MAO).

					opposition from enemy fighters en route from the Belgian coast, to the Alps and out over the
					Adriatic Sea; flak was sporadic and inaccurate. After the target, the bomber turned south and landed
					at the Twelfth Air Force base at Bône, Algeria. Later positioned to Telergma, Algeria. On return to
					England, operated a mission to a Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 24Aug43. Failed
					to return from a mission to the Norma Compagnie roller bearing factory at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43
					(5KIA:3POW:2EVD). Fighter opposition was the strongest encountered to date with about 150 enemy
					fighters attacking the formation. A few spasmodic attacks were made on the formation en route to
					Stuttgart, but the large concentration was first met in the vicinity of the I.P. Because the
					squadron formation was too loose it was open to attack by enemy fighters. The first shot that hit
					the plane was a 20mm cannon shell that burst in the accessories next to the co-pilot. It damaged the
					aileron and the AFCE. Altitude was decreasing and the bomber was far from the formation, but
					continued to fly although slightly wing heavy, despite no.4 engine which had been damaged and
					operating on emergency power. The pilot started to manoeuvre because the plane was out of formation
					and another group of enemy fighters had formed and were attacking it. The elevator controls had been
					operated from the co-pilot's seat since the start of the mission. In formation the plane was flying
					at 21,000 feet; shortly after leaving the formation the altimeter read 17,000 feet. The aileron on
					the co-pilot's side was still in working order. It was too late to put on full power and join the
					formation as the fighter attacks intensified. The pilot motioned for the co-pilot to switch seats.
					The pilot pulled the bomber out of a dive and turned sharply to try and shake off the fighters but
					they continued to score hits in the cockpit, puncturing an oxygen bottle behind the co-pilots seat
					and damaging hydraulic lines to the emergency brake levers. The plane caught fire. At that point,
					the pilot instructed the crew to bail out. Five crew members bailed out before the bomber crashed
					through a house and burned in a meadow on Rue de Beaumont, La Chapelle Champigny, southeast of Paris,
					France (1 civilian fatality - an eighty-year old Frenchwoman in the house); the bodies of five
					airmen were found in or near the wreckage. Claimed by Oberst Egon Mayer flying a FW 190 of III./JG 2.

					Failed to return from a mission to the Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 5Dec43
					(10INT). When the target was found to be completely obscured, the Group turned to its secondary
					target, the Luftwaffe airfield at Cognac. Finding this target also obscured and facing a fuel
					shortage, the planes began jettisoning their bomb loads. Meagre flak along the route intensified
					over target and about a dozen fighters attacked. Over the Bay of Biscay the plane had engine
					problems and had to abandon the formation. After throwing away all the extra weight, including the
					weapons, the crew was afraid of encountering German fighters over the Bay of Biscay, and decided to
					head south to try and reach Gibraltar. Near Sesimbra, south of Lisbon, Portugal, with fuel
					exhaustion, the pilot had to ditch in the Atlantic. The crew exited without a scratch; they were
					rescued by fishing boats and delivered to the American Legation in Portugal that was able to
					repatriate them to UK. SUZANNE.

					up over the English Channel, the Group diverted twice by flying to the French coast then back to the

					the bombers went into the target. Flak was not encountered into or from the target. Returning home
					ten to fifteen miles east of Calais, France, the aircraft was in a mid-air collision with B-17F
					42-30320. A propeller on #320 struck the tail, possibly killing the gunner, and the plane broke
					completely into two sections, behind the waist doors. Those crewmen stationed in the spinning tail
					section were probably unable to escape as it crashed down to earth. In the remaining front section,
					as it went into a left-hand spin, the officers bailed out one by one from the nose hatch. Crashed
					and burned in a field near Sainte-Marie-Kerque, 18km north-northwest of Saint-Omer, France.

					wing of the higher plane cut the fuselage of the plane coming upward in half. A third B-17F
					(42-30774) flew into the wreckage. The first two B-17's that collided fell downward and exploded

					support was satisfactory; accurate flak was encountered at Dümmer See, Germany, but was inaccurate
					over Berlin. Despite problems with the valves of the 'Tokyo' fuel tanks, which had frozen, the plane
					had completed its mission and on returning from the target, the pilot reduced the altitude in an
					attempt to defrost the hydraulic fluid, which operates the valves to the 'Tokyo' tanks, and which
					had frozen up making it impossible for the crew to obtain the fuel from the tanks. Three of the
					engines failed as the plane ran out of fuel just after it left the target because of the hydraulics
					failure. The pilot crawled back to the bomb bay area to try to resolve it; he was unable to open the
					valve. After dropping to a lower altitude, the pilot gave orders to bail out. After they jumped the
					plane sustained a direct hit by flak, exploded and crashed one mile east of Nedlitz, nine miles east

					a large force of aggressive enemy fighters en route to the target and until the formation had
					departed over the North Sea. Flak was moderate over the target and accurate in range. Although in
					flames over the target, the plane returned safely to Rougham. Failed to return from a mission to a
					Luftwaffe airfield and air depot at Le Bourget, Paris, France 14Jul43 (9KIA:2EVD). Enemy fighter
					opposition was intense; meagre to moderate flak, mostly inaccurate, was encountered to the target.
					When the Spitfire escort turned back, the group was attacked by enemy fighters which sought to
					divide the bombers. The aircraft shortly came under enemy fire from three Fw 190 fighters. A second
					round of enemy fighters engaged with the lead aircraft of the formation, B-17F 42-30243. Its crew
					succeeded in destroying one of the enemy fighters which exploded in mid-air. While #243 managed to
					dodge the debris from the exploding fighter, the broken fuselage of the damaged Fw 190 crashed into
					the left wing tip of #331 breaking it off. The collision immediately set the aviation fuel in the
					aircraft alight, and caused the aircraft to burst into flame. At the same time, with the left wing
					damaged, the aircraft lost lift and went into a violent spin. The pilot briefly succeeded in
					regaining control for long enough that two airmen bailed out of the aircraft. Though the waist
					gunners had been thrown from their positions during the collision and lost their oxygen and intercom,
					they bailed out of the crew door; the radio operator also managed to bail out but his parachute
					failed, causing him to fall to his death. The remaining members of the crew did not escape before
					the aircraft crashed at Les Pénétraux, Saint-Germain-des-Angles, 6km north of Évreux, France.

					the remaining engines, left the formation at the African coast. The pilot made a forced landing in a

					killing ten grazing sheep. A guard was placed on the airplane. The next day an engineering crew from
					the 429th Bomb Squadron came and repaired one engine; the engineering pilot took off with three
					engines and flew the plane back to base. Crashed shortly after takeoff from Aïn M'lila for a
					tactical mission in support of Operation Husky to the Messina-Villa San Giovanni ferry terminals,
					Italy 16Jul43 (10KIA). Loaded with sixteen 300-pound bombs, this was the first mission after having
					three new engines installed. Immediately after the plane cleared the ground, engine number one
					failed and the propeller was feathered. Then smoke began coming from engine number two. In a frantic
					effort to maintain altitude, the pilot pulled the nose up as the airplane continued to lose power
					and airspeed. The plane began to mush in a tail low attitude, the left wing went down, and the plane
					crashed. The left wing hit the ground first, the right wing severed a power line, and with that
					instantaneous mixture of high voltage, heat and fuel, thirteen of the sixteen bombs detonated,
					scattering wreckage over a wide area. The only recognizable parts of the plane were four mangled
					engines. {3 missions}. Assigned to DUKO (Twelfth Air Force). Condemned 16Jul43. TUFF TIT.

					formation was repeatedly attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters; moderate to intense flak
					was reported over the target. Leaving the target the plane was struck by flak disabling no.4 engine.
					After the target, the Group turned and headed westward for England. After turning to the rally point
					and heading home, it was found that no.2 engine had been damaged. German fighters, having landed and
					refuelled, attacked again. The no.4 engine had lost oil, the propeller was overspeeding and could
					not be feathered. The plane was losing speed and straggling the formation. No.2 engine caught fire
					and the pilot headed down for the cover of some clouds. By now over the French/German border, a
					couple of enemy fighters came in for the kill. Tail and both waist gunners had been wounded by
					bullet and 20mm cannon shells fragments. The aircraft had been badly damaged and was now down too
					low for the crew to bail out. About 100 feet above the ground the plane rolled over on its right
					side, the right wing crumpled and cushioned the impact of the crash in a ploughed field near Beney-
					en-Woëvre, 800 meters northwest of the cemetery at Bouillonville, southwest of Metz, France. It had

					Substantially damaged in an accident involving B-17F 42-30122 and parked B-17F 42-30127 during
					landing at Ponte Olivo, Gela, Sicily 23Oct43. Failed to return from a mission to the Wiener
					Neustädter Flugzeugwerke factory at Wiener Neustädt, Vienna, Austria 2Nov43 (3KIA:6POW). En route to
					the target, the supercharger on the no.1 engine had failed but the plane was keeping up with the
					Group formation. Almost simultaneous with reaching the Initial Point, flak began working its way
					toward the plane. At the same time, enemy fighters were spotted manoeuvring into position and
					started to attack. A flak shell burst below the right wing, throwing the plane violently upwards.
					The main point of damage was in the wing, directly behind no.3 engine, setting fire to it as well.
					No. 3 engine was completely disabled. The fighter attacks had destroyed the elevator controls and it
					took combined strength to hold the plane straight and level for the bomb run. The tail gunner was
					killed on one fighter pass and the ball turret gunner was apparently killed instantly by the flak
					burst that so damaged the wing. Another flak burst, quite close, destroyed what was left of the
					aileron control and the A.F.C.E. mechanism too was not functioning. After dropping their bombs on
					the target, as the Group rallied on their way home, the crew had no choice but to continue straight
					ahead, hoping to reach a safe place to bail out before the fire reached the fuel tank. One of the
					top turret guns jammed, and being small, the gunner had to duck down out of the turret to clear the
					jam. While thus engaged, a cannon shells from an enemy fighter perforated the cockpit, and a 20mm
					cannon shell burst in the turret, blowing it completely off the plane. The crew started to bail out
					and the plane crashed between Thernberg and Scheiblingkirchen, southeast of Neunkirchen, Austria.

					marshalling yards at Münster, Germany 10Oct43. Over Dordrecht, Netherlands, there was moderate and
					fairly accurate flak. As it approached the city, the formation was swarmed by a large force of enemy
					aircraft for an estimated forty-five minutes of vicious fighting. Intense and accurate flak was also
					encountered. By the time friendly fighter escorts arrived to drive off the Luftwaffe, the damage had
					already been done. Intense and accurate flak was also encountered. During the bomb run flak damaged
					an engine and the plane was unable to keep up with the formation. The pilot continued and dropped
					the bombs over the target alone before turning off. The crew considered going to Switzerland but
					decided to head home. The bomber was attacked by several enemy fighters but avoided serious damage
					by using fighter style evasive tactics and then dropped down into some clouds below. By this time
					another engine had failed. Before the plane reached the enemy coast a third engine failed and the
					crew prepared to ditch in the North Sea as the pilot nursed the remaining engine. Upon reaching
					England, the pilot prepared to land at the first runway he found which was a B-24 Liberator base.
					He called in on the radio, "I'm coming in" and the base replied that they had crippled B-24s
					incoming and that he should circle around one time so they could work them into the formation to
					land, to which he once again said "I'm coming in. Over and Out". As he prepared to land, the last
					engine quit, made a rough 'dead stick' landing and coasted as long as he could before he ground

					target was intense and accurate. The aircraft suffered heavy flak damage over Germany and all four
					engines cut out. the pilot dived the plane to 5,000 feet and managed to restart the damaged engines.
					The crew then had a vote and opted to fly back towards the safety of Britain, rather than trying to
					make it to Switzerland, which was closer. At 5,000 feet the bomber was a sitting duck and repeatedly
					attacked over France where two German fighters further damaged the aircraft, disabling three of the
					four engines. The pilot managed to limp the aircraft back over the English Channel on a single
					engine but had to ditch off Dungeness, Kent. Spotted by a couple of RAF Spitfires, three crew in a
					dinghy were rescued by a Royal Air Force Air-Sea Rescue Supermarine Walrus amphibious aircraft

					the target, flak hit the nose compartment injuring the bombardier but he managed to release the
					bombs accurately. After the bombs had been released, flak destroyed engine no.4, cutting control
					wires and the left elevator was ripped to shreds, plunging the bomber into an out of control
					spinning dive. Regaining control 3,000ft lower, the crew planned how to return to base. Fighting off
					attacks by enemy fighters, the bomber reached the coast, slowly losing altitude. Expecting to ditch
					in the North Sea, equipment was jettisoned to reduce weight. This was sufficient to maintain
					altitude and, eventually, the crew spotted a fighter airfield in East Anglia where the pilot elected
					to land with several injured crew members. With the hydraulics and brakes inoperative, the frayed
					rudder cables snapped as the aircraft touched down leaving the pilots with no control over the
					landing run. The aircraft hit a large tree when it crash landed at RAF Ludham, Norfolk. The tree
					passed between the no.2 engine and the fuselage, spinning the aircraft around. The fighters which
					the crew had spotted on the airfield turned out to be decoys on a dummy airfield; medical help took

					turned to its secondary target, the Luftwaffe airfield at Cognac. Finding this target also obscured
					and facing a fuel shortage, the planes began jettisoning their bomb loads. Meagre flak along the
					route intensified over target and about a dozen fighters attacked. The pilot flew out over the Bay
					of Biscay when the bomber developed engine trouble and dropped out of the formation, flying alone
					about four miles behind the rest of the squadron formation. Two German fighters came upon the plane
					and began an attack from above and below the bomber, resulting in severe damage to the rear end of
					the plane and starting a fire in the radio room. The ball turret and both waist gunners were
					severely wounded during the attack. The pilot ordered the airmen to bail out but then made a
					decision to ditch into the ocean. The plane was approximately twenty miles away from shore when the
					pilot turned it around and began heading back towards the coast as the plane descended. The tail
					gunner and radio operator, who had not been wounded, jettisoned burning equipment prior to the
					landing. After the pilot successfully brought the plane down on the water the crew immediately began
					inflating two rubber life rafts. They escaped the burning plane and the German fighters broke off
					from their attack. The rafts began taking enemy fire from the shore, shot by Indian troops fighting
					for the Germans. After a number of hours had passed, the survivors were picked up by a German Air-
					Sea Rescue plane. Ditched in Bay of Biscay, 6km northwest of Lacanau, France. THE FIGHTING COCK -

					join the other members of the 383rd Bomb Group and continue to England. Around midnight, the captain
					radioed that their position was near Powder River, Wyoming. They were not heard from again. After
					they failed to arrive in Grand Island, the plane was declared missing and the Army mounted a search
					effort with no results. A second search was conducted the following year, concentrating on the Wind
					River Mountains, Absaroka Mountains and Big Horn Mountains, but still no wreckage was spotted. Two
					cowboys spotted something shiny on a ridge line in the Cloud Peak area of the Big Horn Mountains,
					eighteen miles north-northeast of Ten Sleep, WY 12Aug45. They discovered the wreckage and the
					deceased crew. At the time of the accident, the aircraft was nearly 120 miles off course to the
					north and flying below the prescribed flight altitude, thus below the elevation of the Big Horn
					Mountain range. No official cause for the crash was ever determined but it is presumed that
					malfunctioning navigational equipment, and a moonless night combined with bad weather, caused the
					pilot to not see the ridge until it was too late. SCHARAZAD. After a petition by veterans groups in
					Wyoming, the previously unnamed ridge was christened Bomber Mountain by the US Forest Service

					Over Dordrecht, Netherlands, there was moderate and fairly accurate flak. As it approached the city,
					the formation was swarmed by a large force of enemy aircraft for an estimated forty-five minutes of
					vicious fighting. Intense and accurate flak was also encountered. By the time friendly fighter
					escorts arrived to drive off the Luftwaffe, the damage had already been done. There was moderate
					flak and intense fighter operation in the vicinity. The plane dropped out of formation having been
					hit by flak in the tail section, killing the tail gunner. It then split in half and the front
					section went into a spin with only seven of the crew managing to bail out, the pilot and co-pilot
					also losing their lives. Crashed Isendorf, near Emsdetten, Germany. {15 missions}.

					stayed with the formation for only a short time; some flak was encountered, but it was only moderate
					in intensity. Battle damaged during a mission to ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt, Germany
					17Aug43. The formation was subject to continuous fighter attacks from the time it crossed over the
					enemy coast. In addition, the bombers were hit by flak as they passed over anti-aircraft defence
					zones. After the target, and before the formation could rendezvous with a P-47 Thunderbolt escort
					home, the squadron was subjected to further and continuous fighter attacks for about ninety minutes.
					VIII Air Service Command 19Aug43. Regained by Group Sep43. Gee-H radio navigation system installed

					Enemy fighters were seen en route to the target but did not attack; flak was encountered most of the
					way in, becoming heavy approaching the target. From the Initial Point until leaving the target area,
					there was a complete undercast except for small sparse patches of farm land. This group followed the
					lead group over the target area twice without dropping their bombs. Bombs were finally dropped on
					Achern, a small town 18km southwest of Baden-Baden, Germany. Battle damaged during a mission to
					attack the submarine supply ship 'Kertosono' moored at Nantes, France 23Sep43. En route the Group
					was attacked crossing the Brest peninsula by Luftwaffe Fw 190 fighters of III./JG 2. The primary
					target was hidden by an effective smoke screen; bombs were dropped in the dock area. Moderate to
					intense and accurate flak was encountered over the target and at Rennes. Battle damaged on a mission
					to industrial areas at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 4Oct43. Flak over the target was moderate and
					accurate; a large force of enemy fighters was encountered, Bf 110 twin-engined fighters firing
					rockets from a distance beyond the range of the bombers' guns. Battle damaged on a mission to the
					Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft (Deschimag) shipyard at Bremen, Germany 8Oct43.
					The effectiveness of a smoke screen, in combination with a haze that extended to altitude, caused
					the Group to attack the secondary target, the city of Bremen. The formation was met with stiff
					resistance by German fighters the entire way, from the Dutch coast all the way to the target and
					back again. Over the Initial Point and the target, the Group encountered intense flak. Battle
					damaged on a mission to railway marshalling yards at Münster, Germany 10Oct43. Ground haze made
					visibility in the target area very poor. The 384th Bomb Group led the combat wing across the
					northern end of the Ruhr Valley over Hüls, subjecting the formation to the fire of approximately one
					hundred flak guns. The fire was extremely accurate for altitude and deflection; the lead Group took
					no evasive action. At the start of the bomb run, the lead bombardier observed a town burning and,
					mistaking it for the target, made the bomb run on it; the town was later identified as Coesfeld,
					Germany. Enemy fighters were observed but did not attack; the P-47 Thunderbolt escort gave excellent
					protection and coverage. Battle damaged on a mission mission to the port area at Wilhelmshaven,
					Germany 3Nov43. A small force of enemy fighters was seen, but few attacks were made; flak was
					moderate and inaccurate. Battle damaged on a mission to the city of Bremen, Germany 26Nov43. Enemy
					fighter opposition was encountered but eventually chased off by the P-47 Thunderbolt escort; flak
					was accurate and intense over Bremen but meagre and inaccurate to/from the target. Battle damaged on
					a mission to the Deschimag submarine construction yard at Vegesack, Bremen, Germany 16Dec43.
					Moderate to intense accurate flak was encountered at the target with meagre flak along the route.
					German fighters started a determined attack as soon as the bombers turned off the target. Base Air
					Depot No.1, Burtonwood (Station 590), Lancashire 30Jan44. Regained by Group 8Feb44. Battle damaged
					during a mission to the Mühlenbau und Industrie AG aircraft assembly halls at Waggum, Brunswick,
					Germany 29Mar44. Because of cloud cover over the primary and secondary targets and the inability of
					the PFF lead plane to drop its bombs and flares, the briefed targets were not attacked. The Group
					dropped on Unterlüß, northeast of Celle, Germany. Over the target, flak was moderate and accurate;
					en route, flak was meagre and inaccurate. After the target a large force of enemy fighters attacked
					over Celle during a gap in fighter escort. Battle damaged during a mission to the Dornier
					Flugzeugwerke factory at Oberpfaffenhofen, Munich, Germany 24Apr44. Strong enemy fighter opposition
					was encountered as soon as the formation entered Germany. Flak was moderate to intense and accurate
					inbound over the coast; intense and accurate over and after the target. 2nd Strategic Air Depot,
					Abbots Ripton (Station 547), Huntingdonshire 26Apr44. Regained by Group 22May44. Participated in the

					{first combat mission 17Aug43}. Failed to return from a mission to ball bearing factories at

					from the time it crossed over the enemy coast. In addition, the bombers were hit by flak as they
					passed over anti-aircraft defence zones. No.4 engine was hit by flak which caused a slight fuel
					leak but the engine continued to produce power. In a fighter attack an elevator was hit. Flak
					continued along the route but did not hit the plane. Another fighter attack struck the top turret,
					breaking the glass and wounding the gunner. The attack injured the radio operator and disabled the
					electrical system to the ball turret. The tail gunner had been wounded and was replaced by the ball
					turret gunner. On the bomb run, a bullet struck no.2 engine and the propeller had to be feathered;
					this may have been 'friendly fire'. The plane was on its first mission and had not had Group
					markings applied; it is possible that other crews thought that it was a German interloper. Returning
					from the target the plane was not able to keep up with the formation. After the target, and before
					the formation could rendezvous with a P-47 Thunderbolt escort home, the squadron was subjected to a

					(Station 554), Norfolk. 20,000lbs of Torpex explosives, was installed between the cockpit, the radio
					operator room and the bomb bay. The bomb bay was reinforced by beams to support the extra weight of
					Torpex. Expended on Castor mission to the "Nordsee III" submarine bunker at Heligoland, Germany
					30Oct44. The drone was under control up to four degrees east when controls went out. Control was re-
					established at five degrees east and was maintained to the I.P. When turning the drone at the
					Initial Point, it went out of control and took a heading of 345 degrees; all efforts to turn or dive
					the drone failed, although the control ship followed it before turning back, leaving the drone on a
					heading of 345-349 degrees at an altitude of 200 feet. Crashed after fuel exhaustion into the North
					Sea off the Frisian islands, Netherlands.

					Glisy, Amiens, France 15Aug43. The Group split their bomb load and attacked both targets. Meagre to
					moderate, intense and accurate flak was encountered in the target area. No enemy fighters were seen
					and the Spitfire escort was excellent. Gee-H radio navigation system installed Sep43. Battle damaged
					on a mission to attack a submarine suppy ship in the Loire River at Nantes, France 16Sep43. The ship
					was not found in the briefed area, so the Group attacked the secondary target, port facilities and
					shipping. There was moderate and accurate flak from Rennes but at Nantes the flak was moderate and
					inaccurate. A large force of enemy fighters was encountered. Battle damaged during a mission to
					attack the submarine supply ship 'Kertosono' moored at Nantes, France 23Sep43. En route the Group
					was attacked crossing the Brest peninsula by Luftwaffe Fw 190 fighters of III./JG 2. The primary
					target was hidden by an effective smoke screen; bombs were dropped in the dock area. Moderate to
					intense and accurate flak was encountered over the target and at Rennes. Battle damaged on a mission
					to the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft (Deschimag) shipyard at Bremen, Germany
					8Oct43. The effectiveness of a smoke screen, in combination with a haze that extended to altitude,
					caused the Group to attack the secondary target, the city of Bremen. The formation was met with stiff
					resistance by German fighters the entire way, from the Dutch coast all the way to the target and
					back again. Over the Initial Point and the target, the Group encountered intense flak. Accident
					taxying at Grafton Underwood 18Nov43. The aircraft was on a training flight doing circuits at
					Grafton. After landing, the aircraft taxyed around the perimeter where the crew encountered a
					telephone truck which pulled off to the side and the driver gave them the all clear sign but the
					right wing failed to clear the top of the truck, damaging the wing and aileron. The crew then
					proceeded to their dispersal. After several hundred yards the brakes were applied when the tail

					there was weak enemy fighter opposition. Battle damaged on a mission to the Vereinigte
					Kugellagerfabriken AG (VKF) ball bearing factory at Erkner, Berlin, Germany 8Mar44. Enemy fighters
					were observed but did not attack this Group. Meagre and inaccurate flak was encountered at the
					target; along the route flak was moderate and very accurate. Battle damaged on a mission to the
					Alfred Teves KG component factories at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 20Mar44. Bad weather and the risk
					of collision with another formation caused the Group to drop out; unable to find their combat wing
					over Germany, the Group returned home. Moderate, inaccurate flak was encountered to and from the
					target. Battle damaged on a mission to the FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schäfer ball bearing factory at
					Schweinfurt, Germany 24Mar44. Cloud cover and dense contrails cause the Group to divert to the
					secondary target of the Deutsche Dunlop tire and rubber factory at Hanau, Germany. The formation did
					not encounter any enemy fighter opposition. Moderate to intense and accurate flak was encountered
					over the target; along the route flak was moderate. Battle damaged on a mission to the Junkers
					Flugzeug-und Motorenwerke aero engine factory at Dessau, Germany 28May44. Equipment problems on the
					bomb run on the primary target prevented the lead aircraft from releasing its bombs (the signal for
					the rest of the group to drop its bombs). After turning the lead over to the group deputy, the
					secondary target was found to be effectively obscured by a smoke screen, so the formation dropped
					their bombs on a target of opportunity, a factory complex about ten miles east of Leipzig, Germany.
					Only weak resistance was encountered from the German fighter force; there was intense and accurate
					flak over the target. {final combat mission 28May44}. {28 missions}. Modified as a drone for
					Operation Aphrodite missions. 1st Strategic Air Depot, Troston (Station 595), Suffolk. Combat
					equipment was removed except for the navigation table, the VHF and an extinguisher in the cockpit;

					engined fighters firing rockets from a distance beyond the range of the bombers' guns. Battle
					damaged on a mission to railway marshalling yards at Münster, Germany 10Oct43. Ground haze made
					visibility in the target area very poor. The 384th Bomb Group led the combat wing across the
					northern end of the Ruhr Valley over Hüls, subjecting the formation to the fire of approximately one
					hundred flak guns. The fire was extremely accurate for altitude and deflection; the lead Group took
					no evasive action. At the start of the bomb run, the lead bombardier observed a town burning and,
					mistaking it for the target, made the bomb run on it; the town was later identified as Coesfeld,
					Germany. Enemy fighters were observed but did not attack; the P-47 Thunderbolt escort gave excellent
					protection and coverage. Battle damaged on a mission to the port area and railway marshalling yards
					at Bremen, Germany 20Dec43 (1WIA:9RMC). Attacked by a large force of enemy fighters; flak over the
					target area was very intense and accurate. Co-pilot was wounded. Battle damaged on an Operation
					Argument mission to the Erla Maschinenwerk Bf 109 aircraft factory at Mockau, Leipzig, Germany
					20Feb44. A few enemy fighters were sighted but did not attack the Group. Flak at the target was
					moderate to intense and accurate; meagre to moderate flak was encountered along the route. Severely
					battle damaged on a mission to industrial areas in the suburbs of Berlin, Germany 4Mar44. With the
					ground completely obscured by dense cloud, the combat wing turned back east of Koblenz and looked
					for a target of opportunity, initially thought to be Cologne but later determined to be Bonn,
					Germany. Flak was moderate to intense and accurate; a few enemy aircraft were seen, but they did not
					attack the formation. Flak damage to stabilizers,propellers, windows and rudder. Battle damaged on a
					mission to the Alfred Teves KG component factories at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 20Mar44. Bad
					weather and the risk of collision with another formation caused the Group to drop out; unable to
					find their combat wing over Germany, the Group returned home. Moderate, inaccurate flak was

					flak was encountered as the formation made its approach to the factories. On the bomb run flak
					struck and disabled no.2 and no.3 engines as well as damaging the electrical system preventing
					feathering the propellers. On fire, the engines were behaving wildly. Instruments failed because the
					vacuum lines had been cut. The engineer was wounded; the radio and gun turrets were disabled after
					the electrical was hit. Momentum carried the plane through and the bombs were dropped over the
					target. No.4 engine was not functioning normally and the plane tended to veer to the right. Unable
					to maintain altitude or speed, the aircraft dropped back under control. Down at 10,000 feet enemy
					fighters came in to attack but the gunners kept them at bay until the bomber disappeared into cloud
					at 6,000 feet. Unwittingly, the pilot had turned the plane back heading into enemy territory. Coming
					out of the clouds at 4,000 feet, over Saint-Just-en-Chaussée the pilot ordered the crew to bail out.
					The plane crashed near the village of Montiers, 15km north of Clermont, France.

					11Aug43. {first combat mission 15Aug43}. Battle damaged during a mission to ball bearing factories
					at Schweinfurt, Germany 17Aug43 (2WIA:8RMC). The formation was subject to continuous fighter attacks
					from the time it crossed over the enemy coast. In addition, the bombers were hit by flak as they
					passed over anti-aircraft defence zones. After the target, and before the formation could rendezvous
					with a P-47 Thunderbolt escort home, the squadron was subjected to further and continuous fighter
					attacks for about ninety minutes. Both waist gunners were wounded; Staff Sergeant Loring Corwin
					Miller was seriously wounded and awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action while serving as
					right waist gunner on this mission over Germany. Battle damaged during a Crossbow mission to the
					Blockhaus d'Éperlecques V-2 rocket bunker at Watten, Pas-de-Calais, France 27Aug43. Intense flak was
					encountered as the formation approached the target; enemy air opposition was slight with twenty to
					thirty fighters observed but only a few attacks on the Group. Failed to return from a mission to the
					Robert Bosch magneto factory at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43 (7POW:3EVD). Enemy fighters were seen en
					route to the target but did not attack; flak was encountered most of the way in, becoming heavy
					approaching the target. From the Initial Point until leaving the target area, there was a complete
					undercast except for small sparse patches of farm land. This group went over the target area twice
					without dropping their bombs. Bombs were finally dropped on Achern, a small town 18km southwest of
					Baden-Baden, Germany. Having spent too long over the target, the formation was beginning to realise
					that fuel exhaustion would likely lead to many not being able to return to base. Both wings had been
					struck by flak causing fuel leakage. On the return flight to England the no.1 engine was shut down
					and the propeller feathered. The plane was lagging just behind the formation. A few minutes later
					the no.4 engine ran out of fuel and the bomber dropped out of formation south of Amiens, France,
					still heading for the coast. A check showed that there was insufficient fuel remaining to reach the
					English Channel. Then a Fw 190 fighter appeared and attacked the plane, injuring the co-pilot,
					engineer and radio operator. The pilot turned the plane to the south but found it difficult to keep
					in level flight. He instructed the crew to bail out. The right wing came off and the bomber crashed
					at Bois des Moines, 2km northeast of Airion, east of Beauvais, France. {7 missions}. LUCKY THIRTEEN.
					Some of the bomber's parts were excavated post-war; though just small fragments of this aircraft,
					some of these parts will be incorporated into a B-17 recreation project in Asheville, NC.

					Sep43. Failed to return from a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 fighter factory at
					Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44 (8KIA:3POW). The pathfinder was leading the 40th Combat Wing and took
					off from Thurleigh (Station 111), Bedfordshire. While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed
					in over English bases and a recall signal was issued. Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, Air
					Commander of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with
					greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on
					the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer
					and intensified when the American fighters returned home. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal
					support but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for
					themselves on the return trip. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run, with
					intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. On the way back, the bomber was attacked between
					Braunschweig and Hildesheim; the tail was damaged by a rocket fired from an enemy aircraft and had
					to abandon the formation. In the vicinity of Harderwijk, the aircraft was hit again; the front end
					of the aircraft was destroyed, killing/wounding the pilot and co-pilot, and the tail was knocked off
					causing the bomber to pitch up steeply, stall and crash with two engines on fire in the IJsselmeer,
					about 3km northwest of Harderwijk, Netherlands. Only four airmen were able to bail out. The aircraft
					came to rest at the bottom of the IJsselmeer, about five meters below the surface, where it rested
					until 1968/69. Claimed by Fw. Gerd Wiegand of 4./JG26 and Oblt. Artur Beese of 1./JG26. INVICTUS.
					The last resting place of the airplane became dry land during the land reclamation projects of the
					IJsselmeer. It took several expeditions to remove the wreckage, both in 1968 and 1969. There were
					some remarkable finds during the recovery. During 1968 a lump of mud was found containing a camera.
					Unfortunately the camera was opened and most of the film exposed. Only one picture could be saved.
					It shows another B-17 flying below 42-3486, likely taken above or near the target. During the 1969
					recovery a fully equipped life raft was found, still containing all emergency rations. About three
					months after the wreckage was officially cleared (June 27th, 1969), the remains of the body of the
					only missing crew, co-pilot Roy Peterson, were found by a farmer, while ploughing the soil several
					hundred yards from the position of the wreckage. The crash site is in a field northeast of the
					crossing of the Knardijk and Vogelweg in the present polder Oost Flevoland.

					(2KIA:5POW:3EVD). The Luftwaffe was waiting for the bombers; the moment the bombers crossed over
					into mainland Europe, six twin-engine fighters dived out of the sun upon the formation,
					concentrating all their fire on the lead plane. Once the leader had been downed, the fighters swept
					through the lead Squadron. Before the deputy lead had a chance to reassemble the formation, a large
					force of single-engine fighters joined the fray, attacking the other bombers. Struck by flak over
					the target just as the bombs were released, the leading edge of the right wing curled up acting as a
					dive brake and quickly slowing the bomber. No.3 and no.4 engines were disabled, one of them set on
					fire. Attempting to find some cloud cover, several enemy fighters lined up on the left and started
					attacking. Tracer bullets ripped through a wing leaving a trail of flames. Flight controls were
					damaged, a fire had started in the radio room and the plane was losing altitude. The left waist and
					ball turret gunners were fatally wounded; the remaining airmen bailed out between Leeuwarden and
					Groningen. Crashed 300 meters from lake Sneekermeer, Offingawier, Netherlands. Claimed by Lt.

					the attacks. One 0.30 calibre hole in top of right wing; one flak hole in right aileron; one 0.30
					calibre hole right side of fuselage behind co-pilot's compartment; one flak hole in top of pilot's
					compartment; one hole right side of rudder; one 0.30 calibre In left wing damaging a fuel tank; one
					flak hole in bottom of chin turret. Battle damaged on a mission to the Vereinigte Kugellagerfabriken
					AG (VKF) ball bearing works at Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43. En route to the target area, the bomber
					formation was repeatedly attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters. Flak in the target area
					was moderate in intensity and fair for accuracy. After the target, German fighters, having landed
					and refuelled, attacked again. 20mm cannon shell in leading edge of wing between no.3 and no.4
					engine nacelles, oil cooler damaged. Battle damaged on a mission to railway marshalling yards at
					Gelsenkirchen, Germany 5Nov43. Fighter opposition was weak but intense, heavy and accurate flak was
					encountered over the target. One flak hole in leading edge of left horizontal stabilizer; one hole
					in leading edge of vertical stabilizer; one 20mm cannon shell hole in leading edge of vertical
					stabilizer; one hole in leading edge of left outboard wing panel; three flak holes in top of right
					inboard wing panel; one hole in leading edge of right wing between no.3 and no.4 engine nacelles.
					Battle damaged on a mission to the port area of Bremen, Germany 26Nov43. Enemy fighter opposition
					was slight; flak was accurate and moderate in the target area, dispersed areas over the continent
					and outlying islands. One flak hole in left stabilizer which also struck the fuselage; one 20mm
					cannon shell hole in the dorsal fin; a 20mm cannon shell hole in right side of fuselage, forward of
					waist window; a hole through left inboard wing panel behind no.2 engine nacelle and one in the left
					wing flap. Failed to return from a mission to the Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux, France
					31Dec43 (3POW:7EVD). With the primary target obscured by cloud, the formation headed for the
					secondary target, a Luftwaffe airfield at Châteaubernard, Cognac, France. Intelligence reports
					indicated that very little opposition could be expected from this target, but unknown to the
					Americans, a Luftwaffe flak unit had just completed their training at a gunnery school at Saint-
					Nazaire and were being transported to their new assignments. They, along with their guns, were on
					railway trucks close to the airfield, the gunners watching in amazement as the bombers headed
					towards them following the railway lines! Added to this was the fact that because of the supposed
					weak opposition expected, the bomber force had descended to a lower altitude to ensure pin-point
					accuracy with their bombing, thus presenting the Germans with a target they just could not fail to
					miss. About this time, the formation began to have some enemy fighter attacks. The Group continued
					on towards the target and immediately came under intense and deadly accurate anti-aircraft fire
					north of Pauillac but continued to hold their course and released their bomb load. Three engines had
					been damaged and disabled; one propeller had been feathered and only no.1 engine was still running
					and it was clear that the plane would not be able to return to England. At 12,000 feet the pilot
					ordered the crew to bail out but the two pilots stayed with the bomber in an attempt to aid the ball
					turret gunner who was seriously injured and unable to jump. They skilfully effected a crash landing
					with no.2 engine on fire in a pasture at Saint-Seurin de Cadourne, north of Pauillac, north-
					northwest of Bordeaux, France. {10 missions}. ROUGH LUCK / LADY LUCK.

					secondary objective, a Luftwaffe aircraft repair depot at Villacoublay, Paris, France. En route, the
					no.2 propeller oversped and the plane dropped back from the formation. The pilot aborted the mission
					and turned for home. Then the no.4 propeller oversped and the fuel supply to the no.3 engine failed.
					The bomb load was jettisoned as was excess equipment as the plane slowly descended over the English
					Channel. Vibration was bad and a landing would be too risky. Crossing over the English coast at
					about 3,000 feet, the pilot ordered the crew to bail out and set the autopilot to fly the bomber
					back out to sea. The crew landed safely in the area of Shadoxhurst, Ashford, Kent except the tail
					gunner who received a minor injury. The aircraft failed to reach the coast and crashed at Dymchurch,
					Kent near the police station between Lyndhurst Road and Orgarswick Road, about 100 yards short of
					the sea. The bomber demolished trees, telegraph poles, and a number of houses and bungalows, some of

					flying over a complete overcast so, unsure of their position, looked for a target of opportunity,
					the town of Templin, Germany. Accurate flak and enemy fighter attacks were encountered during the
					return home. Battle damaged on a mission to the Vereinigte Kugellagerfabriken AG (VKF) ball bearing
					factory at Erkner, Berlin, Germany 8Mar44. Luftwaffe fighters and flak batteries defending the
					Berlin area mounted a fierce resistance. Battle damaged on a Crossbow mission to a German V-1 flying

					formation found a target of opportunity, the industrial area of Stettin, Prussia. Friendly fighter
					support was good, but in several areas insufficient to cope with the strong enemy opposition;
					moderate to intense and very accurate flak was encountered en route and over the target. On return,
					the formation was subjected to two hard-pressed attacks by enemy fighters. Numerous flak damage

					Berlin, Germany 6Mar44. Flak was reported as moderate and accurate but intense and accurate over
					Berlin. Ground rockets were fired from several locations. Vicious enemy fighter attacks were
					experienced en route to and from the target. Damaged by flak, later attacked on the way back by
					enemy fighters north of Brunswick. Failed to return from a mission to the Messerschmitt experimental
					airfield at Lechfeld, Augsburg, Germany 18Mar44 (10POW). Flak over Augsburg was intense and accurate.
					Finding the target covered by clouds, it was decided to make a visual bomb run on the Dornier
					Flugzeugwerke works at Oberfaffenhofen, Munich. The aircraft was damaged by debris from a collision
					of 42-39830 and 42-37913 over Dieppe, France, en route to the target. Preceding the collision the
					Group leader's plane was hit by flak and aborted the mission. A delay in assuming the lead by the
					deputy leader resulted in a 360 degree turn by the 100th Bomb Group over the French coast at Dieppe.
					In the re-assembly, #830 and #913 were involved in a mid-air collision. The damaged #508 managed to
					continue on to the secondary target but the damage was so great that flight could not be sustained
					for the return leg. A P-47 Thunderbolt offered protection for some time but as the bomber was forced
					to descend lower and lower, the P-47's fuel state forced the pilot, reluctantly, to abandon the
					stricken B-17. A Bf 109 and a Fw 190 fighter joined up with the bomber, one on each wing. Soon they
					gave the pilot a 'thumbs down' signal over a large snow covered field. The bomber crash landed, with
					the pilot making a dead-stick, wheels up landing in the snow covered backyard of a farmer and came
					to rest beside a Luftwaffe airfield near Dornstadt, six miles north of Ulm, Germany. The two
					fighters circled and the Bf 109 lowered his wheels and landed next to the bomber. The German fighter
					nosed over and crashed, but the Luftwaffe pilot was not injured. The Fw 190 circled overhead a few
					more minutes and then departed. JERSEY LILY / BASTARD'S BUNGALOW II.

					target was light but very accurate. Battle damaged on a mission to the industrial area at Frankfurt
					am Main, Germany 29Jan44. Chaff was dropped over the target by the Lead Group of the 94th Combat
					Wing and effectively disrupted the flak defences. Vicious enemy fighter attacks were encountered
					shortly after leaving the target, with twin-engined fighters creating a majority of the damage.
					Failed to return from a mission to a Messerschmitt Bf 110 aircraft component factory at Brunswick,

					flight the aircraft collided with B-17G 43-37684 and crashed at Wood End, near Towcester, Northants
					11Oct44 (4KIS:1RMC). A formation of planes took off from their base at Snetterton Heath for a
					training mission with a mock bombing run above Rugby, Warwickshire. Over the village of
					Farthingstone, before their planned turn at Silverstone to return to base, tragically a formation of
					three aircraft was involved in a horrific mid-air collision at 15,000ft after encountering severe
					turbulence and cloud. The accident was triggered when the pilot of B-17G 42-3510 pulled up and hit
					the nose of B-17G 43-37684 with its tail section. Just as #510 sheared in half, the third B-17
					42-31053 hit #684 with its rudder and also broke in two. Miraculously, the pilot of #510 parachuted
					to safety, while his and the other bombers plummeted to earth at Woodend, west of Towcester, in four
					sections. Although badly damaged 43-37684 was able to limp back to Snetterton Heath. Salvaged

					14Oct43. En route to the target area, the bomber formation was repeatedly attacked by a large number
					of Luftwaffe fighters. Flak in the target area was moderate in intensity and fair for accuracy.
					After the target, German fighters, having landed and refuelled, attacked again. Three 0.30 calibre
					bullet holes in right aileron; one 0.30 calibre bullet hole in left bomb bay door; one 20mm cannon
					shell through base of dorsal fin just below rudder, right side of fuselage damaged as shell exploded
					causing numerous small holes. Battle damaged on a mission to the port area at Wilhelmshaven, Germany
					3Nov43. Moderate, inaccurate flak was encountered over the target. Escort fighters were scheduled to
					cover the whole route over enemy territory but were not on hand for approximately ten minutes
					between the I.P. and the target, during which time the Group was attacked by enemy fighters. Battle
					damaged on a mission to railway marshalling yards at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 5Nov43. Fighter
					opposition was weak but intense, heavy and accurate flak was encountered over the target. Failed to
					return from a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 fighter factory at Oschersleben, Germany
					11Jan44 (2KIA:8POW). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and
					a recall signal was issued. Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb
					Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy
					fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and by
					P-51 Mustangs over the target. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when
					the American fighters returned home. About thirty minutes before reaching the target, the plane was
					subjected to an attack by eight enemy fighters; it received 20mm cannon shell hits from nose to tail.
					The bomb bay was set on fire which prevented the co-pilot from going to the rear of the plane to
					check damage and crew. A 20mm shell entered the cockpit and severely injured the pilot, followed by
					a strike in the waist section from a rocket; both waist gunners were severely injured. The pilot
					pulled the bailout alarm; at this time both wings were on fire. The tail gunner had been killed and
					the tail section broke away before the plane crashed at Pilgrin, 3km southeast of Schorborn, 10km
					east of Holzminden, Germany; wreckage was scattered over a 1km radius. {16 missions}. APRIL GIRL.

					{first combat mission 8Oct43}. Battle damaged on a mission to the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau
					Aktiengesellschaft (Deschimag) shipyard at Bremen, Germany 8Oct43. Owing to difficulty with the
					Automatic Flight Control Equipment and misunderstanding on the interphone, the run on the primary
					target was missed. A run on the secondary target was impossible because of the approach of another
					bomb group, therefore, after reaching the rally point, a target of opportunity, the hangars at
					Quakenbrück was attacked. At the target, flak was accurate and intense; fighter opposition was
					mediocre and attacks were not pressed home. Battle damaged on a mission to the Vereinigte
					Kugellagerfabriken AG (VKF) ball bearing works at Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43. En route to the
					target area, the bomber formation was repeatedly attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters.
					Flak in the target area was moderate in intensity and fair for accuracy. After the target, German
					fighters, having landed and refuelled, attacked again. Flak hole in leading edge of right wing,
					outboard panel, damaging skin and spar; small hole in skin and corrugation of left wing near no.1
					engine nacelle. Battle damaged on a mission to the port area at Wilhelmshaven, Germany 3Nov43.
					Moderate, inaccurate flak was encountered over the target. Escort fighters were scheduled to cover
					the whole route over enemy territory but were not on hand for approximately ten minutes between the
					I.P. and the target, during which time the Group was attacked by enemy fighters. Battle damaged
					during a mission to railway marshalling yards at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 5Nov43 (10RMC). Fighter
					opposition was weak but intense, heavy and accurate flak was encountered over the target. The plane
					had three engines damaged by flak; over the English coast the last engine cut out. The pilot ordered
					his crew to bail out, then headed the plane towards the sea. As he prepared to bail out he saw that
					the plane was veering and heading down towards a large factory on the outskirts of Ipswich. The
					pilot stayed with his plane and made a successful crash landing at RAF Ipswich, Suffolk. Condemned
					salvage 8Nov43. {5 missions}. LUCILLE BALL. Named for comedienne Lucille Ball. Named in the

					Marne, France 27Apr44 (9POW:1EVD). A navigational error made by the 13th Combat Wing's Lead Group
					threw the bombers off their intended course, which in turn put them out of their intended place in
					the greater formation. As a result, they were forced to abandon their briefed target and instead
					seek out any nearby targets of opportunity; they settled on the Luftwaffe airfield at Le Culot,
					Beauvechain, Belgium. The aircraft was struck by flak as it left the target area. No. 3 engine began
					to smoke and the plane began to lag behind. It remained with the formation, however, until west of
					Ghent, Belgium, when the crew bailed out. On fire, it descended in slow spirals, apparently under
					autopilot control, crashed and exploded on a farm at Ardooie, Belgium. One of the bombs came down
					and destroyed a farm house. OL' DAD.

					337th Bomb Squadron [AW*L], 96th Bomb Group, Snetterton Heath (Station 138), Norfolk Sep43. 339th
					Bomb Squadron [QJ*X]. Failed to return from a mission to the Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau AG aircraft
					factory at Krzesiny, Poznan, Poland 11Apr44 (10EVD). On the first leg the Group ran into a few
					scattered areas where there was concentrated flak but the main concern was the incessant fighter
					attacks which dove right through the formation and it appeared that some of them were committed to
					crashing into a bomber to take it down. Over Poznan the Pathfinders could not pick up the targets so
					diverted to the secondary target, the Hydrierwerke Pölitz AG synthetic oil plant at Pölitz, just
					north of Stettin, Prussia. On the way there were more vicious fighter attacks, and the closer to
					Stettin, the heavier the flak. No. 3 engine was struck and disabled over the target, and shortly
					after, and before the bomb bay doors closed, a near miss just below the plane sprung the doors and
					did some minor structural damage so the doors wouldn't close completely. The extra drag, and only
					three engines, made it impossible to keep up with the formation and it started falling behind. By
					the time the bomber was flying over Northern Germany, headed for home via Denmark and the North Sea,
					the pilot decided it would be better off at a lower altitude as he would be able to manoeuvre better
					in the denser air and if he went down to tree top level there would be less chance of ground
					observers or fighters spotting the plane. He started to let down as fast as he could, given the
					condition of the aircraft, when the crew spotted more fighters coming in to attack. They made
					several passes and a 20mm cannon shell entered the cockpit window wounding the co-pilot. No.2 engine
					was hit and disabled and an oil line on no.4 engine was damaged. With one good engine and no.4
					engine not producing full power as it started to overheat with the loss of oil. The pilot had
					managed to partially feather the no.2 propeller, but no.3 could not be feathered causing more drag.
					The pilot knew the plane would never make it to England and decided to head for Sweden. Apparently
					the fighters had either expended their armament or were too low on fuel to press in for the kill, as
					they just peeled off and departed. The plane was extremely hard to hold on course, which had
					calculated to be towards Sweden; the 20mm cannon shell had destroyed the magnetic compass. The plane
					was flying on only the no.1 engine, the no.4 engine having run so hot from lack of oil that it froze.
					Steadily losing altitude, the crew jettisoned everything possible, all 0.50 calibre machine guns,
					all remaining ammunition, all ten parachutes as several of them had been rendered useless by enemy
					fire, and every crew member elected to ride the plane down, though the risk of a crash landing was
					very great, badly shot up as the plane was. Just before touch down the plane struck a telephone pole
					about six or eight feet in from the wingtip, which slewed the plane around enough to prevent it from
					crashing through a farm house which had been directly in its path. As it landed, the weakened plane
					opened up just ahead of the radio room and acted like a plough. The aircraft crash landed on a farm
					100 meters southwest of Bækkemosevej, north of Tåstrup on the island of Sjælland, Denmark. The crew
					left the bomber and hid in a nearby wood; a farmer who was harrowing his fields saw the landing and
					hid the tracks of the flyers by harrowing the area. They were taken by fishing boat to Sweden during
					the night 14/15Apr44 and repatriated to Scotland on a courier flight 26Apr44.

					enemy fighters was encountered in the vicinity of the Initial Point where the friendly fighter
					escort turned back; flak was intense and accurate. One engine was struck by flak prior to reaching
					the Initial Point. The tail gunner had installed extra armour plating and, with a headwind, the
					plane was slow and alone. The pilot asked for the shortest route to the target. The plane was then
					attacked by enemy Bf 110 fighters, striking the oxygen and electrical systems. The rudder had been
					shot in half and the no.2 engine disabled. The bomb load was manually jettisoned but the bomb bay
					doors could not be closed. The tail gunner stayed at his position, even after he was wounded, and
					warded off many enemy attacks, including shooting down a Bf 110. Suddenly the plane descended below
					the clouds, and it seemed that the English Channel was ahead. The crew was planning an emergency
					landing in Britain, or in the water, when two Bf 109s dived towards the bomber. And what happened
					then was astonishing. One of those Messerschmitts was quietly making circles above the B-17. The
					other came in slowly and cautiously. He seem surprised that the plane was still in the air. That's
					how he positioned himself next to the cockpit. And it seemed like he was saluting and pointing down
					to indicate that they should land. The bomber pilot pretended not to see him and shouted to the
					navigator and bomb aimer, who also operated the new nose turret, that that Bf 109 was slowly coming
					into their firing range. The navigator fired three rounds and missed. The Bf 109 pilot, saluting
					again, very calmly pulled up and blasted engines no.1 and no.4 to shreds. He wasn't trying to shoot
					the plane straight out of the sky or hit the crew. He was a brave and honest gentleman. But it
					didn't seem so at the time. The engines were burning and the crew had to get out. When most of the
					crew had bailed out. The pilot let go of the controls but the plane suddenly climbed with its nose

					2Oct43}. Battle damaged on a mission to the Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 5Jan44
					(9WIA:2RMC). Flak was encountered in the target area which was accurate and moderate in intensity;
					fighter attacks were encountered in the Bordeaux area and again over the Brest Peninsula. In these
					attacks the bomber was hit by a 20mm shell and bullets from fighters in a head-on attack. The pilot
					was wounded and the cockpit was in flames. The co-pilot put the plane in a dive and the fire went
					out. At this time the plane was down at 10,000ft. With the co-pilot alone in the cockpit, enemy
					fighters again attacked; the gunners knocked down four of these and drove off the rest. In the end,
					with the co-pilot now in the pilot's seat and the bombardier as co-pilot, the plane was able to
					return to Knettishall. Battle damaged on a mission to the Robert Bosch subsidiary Dreilinden
					Maschinenbau GmbH (DLMG) producing aircraft accessories at Kleinmachnow, southwest of Berlin,
					Germany 6Mar44 (1WIA:9RMC). Flak to and from the target was generally moderate and inaccurate; over
					the target it was intense and accurate. Approximately fifteen to twenty Fw 190s were met near Dümmer
					See en route to the target. Instead of attacking the assigned target, the formation circled the
					outskirts of the city to a textile works on the banks of the Elbe River at Oranienburg. The pilot
					had to leave the formation when a propeller oversped on one engine and the supercharger failed on
					another over Berlin. When the plane left the formation, two enemy fighters swept in for the kill.
					The tail gunner is credited with driving off the fighters and was wounded. The pilot dove the plane
					for the ground and started the long trip home. At the lower level, one of the faltering engines came
					back to life, so the bomber had three engines for its low-level flight across Germany and it made it
					safely back to Knettishall. Failed to return from a mission to the industrial areas of Brunswick,
					Germany 23Mar44 (2KIA:8POW). The formation was about fifteen minutes early when it crossed the enemy
					coast and even earlier when it reached the target. Consequently, no friendly fighter escort was met
					until the formation was near the I.P. During this time a large force of enemy fighters was
					encountered between Dümmer See and Steinhuder Meer, Wunstorf, Germany. The route home was south of
					the briefed course and the formation flew through the northern defences of the Ruhr Valley,
					encountering intense flak. Damaged by flak at the northern defences of the Ruhr Valley, the bomber
					dropped out of the formation with the engines smoking but under control. The crew bailed out, the
					plane exploded and crashed at Hullern, five miles east of Haltern am See, Germany. {21 missions}.

					Failed to return from a mission to the port at Bremen, Germany 26Nov43 (2MIA:1KIA:7RTD).
					In the target area, the group encountered intense flak and a large number of enemy fighters.
					Short of the target, the aircraft sustained extensive structural damage and the loss of No.3 engine.
					It was unable to keep up with the formation. The pilot ordered the bombs to be jettisoned, but one,
					fully armed, hung up in the bomb rack. The flight engineer left the top turret, went into the open bomb bay
					at 40-degrees below zero, and freed the bomb. The fighter attacks continued, and an incendiary shell
					started a fire in the cockpit. Again the flight engineer left his turret to put out the fire, though he was
					almost overcome by the acrid smoke. In the interval between these events, he is credited with shooting
					down one enemy fighter and damaging another. Diving into the clouds for protection, the bomber
					broke out at 6,000ft directly over the city of Emden, where it came under heavy attack by antiaircraft
					guns. By this time the oxygen and electrical systems and all instruments were knocked out,
					a quarter of the nose shot away, the flight controls and all four engines damaged. Once over the
					icy waters of the North Sea with more than 200 miles between the bomber and its home base at
					Grafton Underwood, the flight engineer helped the pilots restart the No.3 engine, which ran only
					spasmodically. Then No.4 quit and its propeller couldn't be feathered. Ditching was imminent.
					The flight engineer made repeated trips through the open bomb bay passage to supervise the
					jettisoning of equipment. Finally No.1 and No.2 engines, which had been running erratically, failed.
					The wake of a ship was sighted in the distance. The pilot headed for it with little hope of success.
					The bomber was losing altitude too rapidly. Since the radio was out, the flight engineer found
					a Very pistol and fired flares in hopes that the ship's crew would see them. The flight engineer
					next assembled the crew in the radio compartment and prepared them for ditching about 40 miles
					from the coast of England in rough seas. When the B-17 hit the surface, water poured in through
					the damaged nose and the open bomb bay, breaking the aircraft in two just aft of the radio
					compartment. The flight engineer directed the other crew members in inflating and launching
					an undamaged life raft and helped those who couldn't get aboard the raft into the water.
					He was last to leave the sinking B-17, but only after he had searched for and found the emergency radio.
					The flight engineer was last seen plunging into the icy water, still clutching the radio. Before he could
					fight his way to the life raft, he was swept away by the waves and lost. Ten minutes later an RAF
					rescue boat pulled one man from the water and took aboard six from the raft. Lost with the
					flight engineer were the tail gunner and one of the waist gunners. The flight engineer, TSgt. Maurice Henry,
					was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, second only to the Medal of Honor. {12 missions}.

					by strong headwinds. Twenty minutes later the plane dropped down from 18,000ft to 8,000ft.
					As it levelled off, the bomber was attacked by enemy fighters. The bombardier was wounded
					and several cannon shells exploded in the radio room. No.4 engine, though feathered, was split open.
					The No.1 engine had also been shut down and the propeller feathered to save fuel. Despite attacks
					by more than fifteen fighters, the pilot used RAF tactics to corkscrew and avoid more damage.
					Later, a fire in the bomb bay was extinguished but the radio operator was wounded and the
					right wing behind No.3 engine had been shot away. When the remaining two engines stopped with

					Battle damaged on a mission to the torpedo store of the submarine base at Saint-Nazaire,
					France 3Jan43. West of Nantes, France, the anti-aircraft fire was strong; south of the
					Loire the fire of the battery of Château Bougon, Couffé, was very heavy, and a strong defence
					was encountered in the region of Paimboeuf. Strong head winds slowed the advance
					of the formation during the last part of the flight. Flak was intense and precise above t
					he objective. An engine was set on fire over the target. German fighters quickly intercepted
					the formation, attacking first the bombers damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Battle damaged
					on a mission to the railway marshalling yards at Hamm, Germany 4Mar43. The weather
					was bad from takeoff through to Germany preventing four other groups rendezvousing with
					the 91st Bomb Group which proceeded alone to the target. Sixteen planes faced the toughest
					fighter defence of the war, the heaviest flak areas, and on the deepest penetration yet into Germany.
					The reception was immediate with German fighters determined to stop the attack; the return
					flight home was no easier, flying into the wind of a strong jetstream. Severely battle damaged
					during a mission to the Chemische Werke synthetic rubber works at Hüls, Marl, Germany 22Jun43;
					wing replaced. Failed to return from a mission to the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt,
					Germany 17Aug43 (10POW). The formation was subject to continuous fighter attacks from the
					time it crossed over the enemy coast. In addition, the bombers were hit by flak as they passed
					over anti-aircraft defence zones. With damage to engine No.1 and No.2, the aircraft lagged behind
					the formation. Unable to continue, the bomber turned back before reaching the River Rhine
					and crashed at St Goar, fifteen miles south of Koblenz, Germany. {20 missions). Shot down by Fw. Heinz

					on the formation. Over the target, flak damaged the cockpit. It was then attacked by enemy fighters

					The group leader abandoned the mission when they ran into bad weather to the east

					damaged on a mission to the Chemische Werke synthetic rubber works at Hüls, Marl,
					Germany 22Jun43. The formation was slow on the climb phase to target altitude, which
					was 24,500 feet. It crossed the Frisian Islands around 21,000ft, and the plane took a flak
					hit on the right side, damaging number four engine. The pilot had to feather the propeller
					and despite pulling full power on the other three engines, he was unable to maintain formation
					position in the climb. The plane dropped back to the left side of the formation and was being
					attacked by two or three Fw 190 fighters, so the pilot decided to abort and make a run for it
					back to England, before more fighters appeared on the scene. He told the crew that he was
					turning back, that he was going to dive to treetop level, and for the bombardier and navigator
					to direct him over the island where the flak battery was situated and to set up a bombing
					run on the guns. The bomber approached the target and the ground battery was firing fast
					at it; the gun crew probably realized they were the target. The bomb run lasted less than a
					minute, and at bomb release, the pilot racked the plane over in a steep turn to avoid the
					flak ahead. The bombardier called in direct hits on the island, and the pilot headed home.
					Failed to return from a mission to the synthetic oil refinery at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 12Aug43
					(4KIA:6POW). The formation was subject to intense enemy fighter attacks which started about an
					hour after crossing the coast. The first enemy fighter attacks badly damaged the plane. Eight inches
					of the stabilizer was shot away and the aircraft caught fire. Inside, the plane was a shambles
					of torn metal and severed cables. Both waist gunners were struck by 20mm shells and wounded.
					Another fighter pass roared through the formation and fired more 20mm shells into the
					fuselage killing a waist gunner. The tail gunner managed to extricate himself from his cramped
					position and bail out but his parachute caught fire. The wreckage of the plane plunged to earth
					at Brünninghausen near Dortmund, Germany. Damaged first by Hauptmann Johannes Naumann
					of JG 26/6, then shot down by Obfw. Adolf Glunz of JG 26/4 in a Fw 190A-5. {33 missions}.

					(1WIA). Severely battle damaged on a mission to the Luftwaffe air
					depot at Romilly-sur-Seine, France 20Dec42. Enemy fighters attacked most of the way from
					entering France until returning to the English Channel. About ten minutes after the target the
					plane was hit by German fighter 20mm cannon projectiles. The aircraft was badly damaged,
					shattering the stabiliser, No.3 engine was disabled and No.2 engine damaged by cannon shells.
					The Plexiglas nose was shattered and elevator controls damaged. Because of the damage the
					bomber slowed and, contrary to regulations, the other 306th Bomb Group planes also did to
					provide protection. The plane was under enemy attack for the entire one hour fifty-three
					minutes that it was over enemy territory. The pilot instructed the crew to standby to jump
					because it appeared that the damaged right stabilizer would rip off. It did not and the plane
					proceeded back to base. The damaged stabilizer caused the plane to veer to the right of the
					runway so the pilot circled the base and the second landing attempt was perfect. Without
					hydraulics or brakes, the plane landed and avoided a tractor and another B-17. Battle damaged

				5123 (MSN 3662) Geiger Field, Spokane, WA 28Sep42. 20th Bomb Squadron, 2nd Bomb Group,
					Great Falls AAB, MT 1Dec42. The aircraft was left wingman of a three-aircraft training
					mission which departed Great Falls AAB for Ainsworth Field, NB 30Dec42. Approaching
					an overcast, the formation followed standard procedure to increase separation distances.
					On top, this aircraft was not seen nor could it be contacted by radio. Eye witness accounts
					suggest wing icing as the bomber was seen in a flat spin over Melstone, MT. Tail surfaces
					were noted with loose fabric and the engines may have been at full power. The bomber
					crashed in the Bull Mountains, south of Mussellshell, MT (12KIS 10 crew and 2 pax).
					It slid along the ground passing between two pine trees which ripped off the wings and
					starting a brush fire. Examination of wreckage from another B-17 showed that elevator
					fabric had torn loose from the supporting metal trailing edge structure. Boeing accident
					investigators concluded that separation of the fabric from the elevator was caused by a
					new attachment method. Unlike hand lacing where the needles passed between fabric threads,
					the pronged clips caused small tears in the fabric which escalated into attachment
					separation under pressure. An engineering fix had been designed and instituted on
					production models and follow-on Army Technical Orders were issued for retrofits
					on in-service aircraft; this plane had not been modified. Salvaged by a crew from Great Falls AAB 31Dec42.

					depot at Romilly-sur-Seine, France 20Dec42 (10RTD). Enemy fighters attacked most of the
					way from entering France until returning to the English Channel. Returning for home
					after the target, it was attacked by enemy Fw 190 fighters. A cannon shell severly
					damaged the right elevator. Another shell blew out a life raft which destroyed the
					radio aerial and caught on the tail causing excess drag and vibration. An aileron
					and No.2 engine supercharger had been damaged. The plane was using excess
					fuel to keep up with formation but made it back to Thurleigh for a very important
					appointment with a three-year old orphan. The plane was the trial installation fitted
					with two 0.50 caliber nose guns, produced by two ground crew members.
					Failed to return from a mission to the submarine pens at Lorient, France 6Mar43 (1KIA:1EVD:8POW).
					Damaged by flak after the target, damaging No.3 and 4 engines; neither propeller
					could be feathered. No.4 engine was on fire and No.3 lost all oil pressure.
					The plane was heading out to sea in an attempt to reach England when the No.3 engine seized,
					the crankshaft sheared, the propeller spun off the engine and cut a swathe through the
					fuselage directly in front of the co-pilot. It shattered the windshield and instrument panel,
					badly wounding the co-pilot. No.4 engine continued to burn and at risk of reaching the fuel
					tank. Unable to extinguish the fire, the pilot turned back towards land and made landfall at
					Guilvinec heading north. Down to 3,000ft and passing Pont-l'Abbé the crew bailed out.

					91st Bomb Group which proceeded alone to the target. Sixteen planes faced the
					toughest fighter defence of the war, the heaviest flak areas, and on the deepest
					penetration yet into Germany. The reception was immediate with German fighters
					determined to stop the attack; the return flight home was no easier, flying into the
					wind of a strong jetstream. Failed to return from a mission to the Chemische Werke
					synthetic rubber works at Hüls, Marl, Germany 22Jun43 (10POW). The bomb run
					from the I.P. to the target was along the Ruhr 'flak alley'. Flak struck the No.1 engine,
					the propeller was feathered and the plane continued to drop its bombs. After the target,
					No.3 engine caught fire but the propeller could not be feathered. No.2 engine was not
					pulling full power. The bomber dropped out of formation and was attacked by enemy fighters.
					The tail and ball turret gunners were wounded, the Plexiglas nose had been
					shot off and the hydraulic system damaged. Excess weight was jettisoned to try and

					railway marshalling yards at Hamm, Germany 4Mar43. The weather was bad from takeoff through
					to Germany preventing four other groups rendezvousing with the 91st Bomb Group which proceeded
					alone to the target. Sixteen planes faced the toughest fighter defence of the war, the heaviest flak areas,
					and on the deepest penetration yet into Germany. The reception was immediate with German fighters
					determined to stop the attack; the return flight home was no easier, flying into the wind of a strong
					jetstream. Battle damaged on a mission to the Deutsche Werke Kiel AG shipyard at Kiel, Germany 19May43.
					Flak over the target was moderate and accurate, striking and damaging the plane. Battle damaged on a
					mission to the submarine yards at Wilhelmshaven, Germany 21May43. Enemy fighter opposition was
					vicious both before and after the target. Flak was moderate to intense, damaging the plane.
					Failed to return from a mission to the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt, Germany 17Aug43 (6KIA:4POW).

					Group was forced to make two bomb runs in order to locate the target. They were at 30.000 feet
					attempting to locate a break in the undercast when the flight became separated in the clouds.
					Three of the bombers bombed through a sudden break in the clouds and were turning to head for
					home - then it happened. In just seconds two flak bursts knocked out two engines and three fuel tanks.
					In a matter of minutes it lost 8.000 feet of altitude. The ailerons and rudder had been shot away.
					The pilot fought the controls while the pull of gravity kept the crew pressed to the floor. Fuel and oil
					flowed through the fuselage soaking the airmen. The airplane began to level out. Over the
					Mediterranean Sea the crew began to strip the plane of excess weight to aid the overloaded engines.

					from a mission to the railway marshalling yards at Padua, Italy 11Mar44 (10MIA). A group of
					lower flying B-24 Liberators on a different axis of attack caused the planes of the 2nd Bomb Group
					to abort the run and make a 360 degree turn to the right for a second bomb run at the target.
					This gave time for enemy fighters to assemble for an attack on the bombers. Fighters started
					attacking the formation and damaged this plane with a rocket on the first pass. There was a
					large hole in the left wing and fuel was coming out of the number two engine fuel tank.
					Several minutes later, this tank caught fire, then the plane pulled up high, and started dropping
					behind the formation. It turned off to the right, the bomb bay doors opened and the crew
					bailed out, the last three just as the left wing came off and before the plane exploded.

					Severely damaged by flak over the target, damaging two engines and setting them on fire.
					The plane dropped out of formation and attempted to return to England. Having crossed the
					northern coast of Brittany and flying over the English Channel near the archipelago of Sept-Îles,
					north of Perros Guirec, it was then attacked by several German Fw 190 fighters. A cannon shell
					set fire to a third engine and another kills a waist gunner. With the situation now desperate,
					and to avoid drowning, the pilot turned back towards France so that the crew could bail out
					over land and receive treatment for injuries. The plane was difficult to maneuver, but after
					much effort, the two pilots managed to turn it towards land while descending towards a cloudy
					area which will hide it from the enemy and at a lower altitude where bail out will be safer.
					The fire in the engines was growing, causing a loss of airspeed. Back above Breton soil,
					the pilot orders the crew to abandon the aircraft quickly. This was above La Roche-Derrien
					towards Pontrieux then Saint-Gilles-les-Bois. Nine of the crew managed to bail out. T

					Damaged when an accidental discharge of the gun a waist gunner was testing put
					several rounds of 0.50 caliber rounds through the tail assembly of his own plane
					at Bassingbourn 17Jan43. Damaged on a mission to the submarine yards at Wilhelmshaven,
					Germany 22Mar43. Propeller shaft on No.3 engine broke when forty miles from enemy coast;
					the pilot could not feather the propeller. He jettisoned the bombs through the bomb bay doors
					and dove from 25,000ft to return across the North Sea at fifty feet. The propeller dropped off just
					after reaching England and landed safely at Bassingbourn. Battle damaged on a mission to the
					Gerhard Fieseler Werke (GFW) aircraft works at Waldau, Kassel, Germany 30Jul43. At the target
					flak was accurate and intense; there was large enemy fighter opposition en route to and returning
					from target. Accident on a mission to the synthetic oil refinery at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 12Aug43
					(1DOI:9RTD). A gunner died of anoxia when his oxygen mask froze. Battle damaged during a Crossbow
					mission to the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques V-2 rocket bunker at Watten, France 27Aug43. There was
					moderate and accurate flak in the vicinities of Caen and the target. A force of enemy fighters
					attacked during the bomb run. The bomber was damaged by flak, 20mm and 0.30 caliber fire.
					Failed to return from a mission to the Arado Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory, Anklam, Prussia 9Oct43
					(1KIA:9POW). Just north of the West Frisian lslands the plane reached its planned altitude of 12,000ft.
					At this time there were occasional fighter attacks by Bf 110s and Bf 109s. Over Mecklenburg Bay
					the plane turned southeast towards Berlin and the flak and fighter attacks became more intense.
					The left waist gunner was killed in a fighter attack by a single 7.8mm round. Then there was an
					explosion under the aircraft and the ball turret gunner reported that the bomb bay doors had
					been damaged. When the bomber approached Anklam for the bomb run the bombardier tried
					to open the bomb bay doors but nothing happened; the doors were jammed. The pilot then
					ordered the bombs held rather than manually cranking open, since the plane could drop behind
					the formation if they couldn't reclose the doors, and the five 100lb incendiaries, in addition to
					the three 1000lb bombs, might not clear the aircraft. Across Mecklenburg Bay again and the
					northern part of Schleswig-Holstein there were fighter attacks from the rear, and also considerable
					flak. The tail gunner was wounded by a 20mm cannon shell. The ball turret gunner continued to
					operate the ball turret as a decoy, but the right gun was out of action from an earlier hit by a 7.8mm
					armor-piercing round, and the left was out of ammunition. The other guns aboard were out of
					commission or out of ammunition also. When the plane was within sight of the North Sea, a number
					of 20mm shells struck the top turret putting it out of commission and starting a small fire.
					Moments later an 88mm shell exploded nearby, cutting the flight control cables, and the aircraft
					went into a diving right turn. The pilot immediately turned on the auto-pilot in an attempt to regain
					control. The plane was out of the group formation now, with only partial control possible.
					More 20mm shells entered the cockpit, and an oxygen tank was ruptured, causing every floating
					particle to burst into flames, filling the cockpit with a flash fire. The pilot ordered the aircraft
					abandoned and the crew bailed out just before it crashed and exploded in a field at Kragstedt,
					near Flensburg, Germany. {15+ missions). Claimed by Uffz. Karl Fey
					in Bf 110G-20 of ZG 1/1. MACR 898. 1 KIA, 9 POW.

					Nearing the target, the 97th Bomb Group was forced to circle to permit the 301st Bomb Group to
					attack first, as planned. During the turn the second element of three was misplaced and as the
					flight approached the assigned target it was attacked by three enemy fighters. Struck by flak
					over the target damaging the engines on the left wing. As the plane dived
					and headed for home the enemy fighters attacked again. After they withdrew, the No.3 engine
					stopped and the pilot crash landed the plane in allied territory near El Kef, Tunisia, about
					40km east of the Algerian border. Salvaged and returned to service. Biskra, Algeria 3Jan43.
					Battle damaged on a mission to the docks at Bizerte, Tunisia 29Jan43. Turning after the target, the
					plane was attacked by enemy fighters, disabling the No.2 engine. The bomb bay doors would
					not close, the drag slowing the bomber and beginning to lag behind the formation.
					The ball turret and a waist gunner were injured by flak shrapnel. The No.3 engine was struck by
					cannon shells and caught fire but it was extinguished when the plane went into a steep dive.
					The remaining gunners were wounded in further attacks by the fighters. During their last attack,
					three machine gun bullets struck the pilot's chest, one bullet passing through and hit the i
					nstrument panel, another, an incendiary bullet, lodged in his chest. None hit a vital organ and
					the pilot continued in control of the bomber. The plane was now down at 1,000ft when
					another engine failed and the crew prepared for a crash landing. With only one engine producing power,
					no wing flaps to slow the plane, wheels up, fire in the cockpit and injured crew, the bomber was
					deliberately bounced off two successive hills about a half mile apart in an attempt to slow it down.
					The plane stopped on contact with a third hill, stopping quickly in a short distance,
					knocking off the tail section. The crash was witnesses by Arabs who sent for British troops.

					in the five-man life raft, both of which were tied together. Two days later a storm arose at sea and the crew
					thought it best to untie them as a safety precaution. During that storm the two life rafts lost sight of each other.
					Of those three, one drowned and the other two were rescued and taken prisoner. Two RAF Spitfire fighters spotted the
					seven men on Christmas Eve, a Royal Air Force Air-Sea Rescue Supermarine Walrus amphibious aircraft
					attempted to land but the sea swell was too heavy. On the afternoon of Christmas Day, a landing craft
					arrived and took the airmen to Termoli and thence to hospital in Foggia. {11 missions}.

					Cambridgeshire 8Feb43. Battle damaged on a mission to railway marshalling yards, Hamm, Germany 4Mar43.
					The weather was bad from takeoff through to Germany preventing four other groups rendezvousing with the
					91st Bomb Group which proceeded alone to the target. Sixteen planes faced the toughest fighter defence
					of the war, the heaviest flak areas, and on the deepest penetration yet into Germany. The reception
					was immediate with German fighters determined to stop the attack; the return flight home was no easier,
					flying into the wind of a strong jetstream. The plane was hit by 20mm cannon fire from a Bf 109
					which shot out part of the oxygen system and some of the electrics preventing release of the bomb
					load over the target. As the formation turned for home, continuously attacked all the way back to the
					coast, the plane took more damage from 20mm cannon shells which smashed into one engine, wounding the
					navigator and co-pilot. Hydraulic lines were also severed and the pilot had glass splinters from the
					shattered cockpit window in one eye, which impaired his vision considerably. The bomber limped
					back to base behind other survivors of the group. The bomb load of sensitive RDX explosive could
					not be safely jettisoned because of the plane's low altitude and so a landing had to be attempted
					with it still on board. Without hydraulics, the plane had no brakes and overshot on landing at
					Bassingbourn. It tore through bushes, then a fence and came to rest blocking a road. Failed to return
					from a mission to the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt, Germany 17Aug43 (8KIA:1POW:1EVD).
					The plane was en route to the target flying the outside corner position in the low squadron when
					the formation was attacked by Fw 190s from the Luftwaffe's 1/JG 26, possibly flown by Ofw Friedrich
					Lindelaub and his Staffelkapitän, Oblt Artur Beese. The German fighters came in to attack in tight
					formations, mainly from dead ahead. The first pass missed but the second did not. Cannon shells and bullets
					sliced through the plane and smashed into the leading edge of the left wing between the engines causing the
					entire wing to break away. The ship went into a tight spin and the centrifugal force pinned the crew inside,
					most had not had the chance to clip on their parachutes. As the tremendous unseen forces built up within it,
					the plane split apart, disintegrated and crashed at Baelen, west of Eupen, Belgium. MACR 280.

					Marrakech to Biskra 3Jan43 (9RTD). The plane was in a flight of three which were detailed to join
					the 97th Bomb Group; problem was, no-one told the Bomb Group to expect the flight. They found
					themselves over a solid undercast, preventing visual navigation and the airfield at Biskra did not
					respond to any radio calls. Dropping down, they realised they were over the enemy territory of Tunisia.
					Two of the planes were attacked by German fighters, one crash landing and the other landing in the
					desert. Intending to force land alongside, the pilot aborted when the other crew fired a red flare
					and headed towards the west in the dusk. Still unable to find Biskra, the pilot turned south to avoid
					the mountains. He climbed to 11,000ft then flew until the fuel was exhausted. The crew bailed out
					over the desert and were assisted by Arabs and French soldiers in reaching Biskra.

					Damaged landing at Molesworth 31May43. Accident on return from a mission to the

					bomber was caught in propeller wash and was thrown around the sky.
					One engine flamed out with fuel exhaustion but the engineer raised the landing gear
					to reduce the drag and the pilot was able to regain control to go around and land
					safely (2INJ). Battle damaged on a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190
					manufacturing factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44 (2KIA:8RTD). While the aircraft
					were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and a recall signal was issued.
					B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target.
					This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks.
					Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and
					by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal support
					but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend
					for themselves on the return trip. It proved to be the most disastrous of the 303rd
					Bomb Group combat missions flown to date. The 303rd lost eleven of the forty B-17s
					flying the mission. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when
					the American fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced
					on the bomb run, with intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. On return the

					Crashed seven miles northeast of Gowen 25Apr43 (3KIS:1DOI:6INJ). The bomber took off from
					Gowen Field for an instrument and practice bombing training mission in the early morning
					hours of 25Apr43. The aircraft headed east as it climbed, and began a left hand turn to circle
					back over the field. The pilot was unable to see approaching terrain in the dark, and the bomber
					struck a 5,700ft. ridge north east of Boise. It broke in half, crashed into a ravine, and burned.
					The navigator started down the mountain to get help. At sunrise he followed the sound of church
					music coming up the canyon on Easter Sunday. On the outskirts of Boise he met a rescue team
					from Gowen Field. The men included Lt. James Stewart, the Hollywood actor, who was training
					as a B-24 pilot at Gowen. Miraculously, six crewmen survived with injuries. Three gunners
					in the rear of the aircraft were killed. The pilot died of his injuries in the hospital two days later.

					Landing gear damaged in an accident during maintenance at Walla Walla Field 26May43.
					Crashed after the No.3 engine caught fire two miles west of Paterson, WA 10Aug43 (7KIS:3RTD).
					The engineer was sitting on the floor of the top turret watching the instruments, when the co-pilot
					called out that the number three engine was on fire. He looked out to find the engine burning so
					hot that the cowling was melting and blowing off in the slipstream. He told the pilot to feather the
					propeller while he and the co-pilot attempted to put the fire out with the extinguisher; it did not work.
					He then feathered the propeller and pushed the power to full on number two, which for some reason
					the pilot had reduced. The bombardier came up from the nose and asked what to do; he was told to
					jettison the bombs. At that point everyone began to put on their parachutes. The engineer then went
					through the bomb bay where he found that the bombardier had indeed dropped the bombs, but failed
					to open the bomb bay doors. A gunner was jumping on the doors; he was told to get off the doors
					and then the engineer used the emergency release. The bombs fell away into the Columbia River.
					He called to the pilot to get out from over the river so they could jump. As he was watching the pilot
					come toward the bomb bay, the fuselage melted away and the bomb bay was filled with smoke, flame,
					and molten metal. The engineer jumped and floated to safety. Three crew bailed out successfully
					but seven crew members were still on board when the right wing exploded. Salvaged 13Aug43

					training flight with a warning of bad weather ahead. Unable to climb on top of the overcast,
					which caused loss of radio contact caused by static, the pilot attempted to reach clearer weather
					at Las Vegas. Encountering turbulence, he turned back towards Wendover. After holding over the
					area for a couple of hours, the pilot proceeded to Salt Lake City but was unable to make radio
					contact to determine his position or weather conditions. Seeing a hole in the cloud and
					with fuel exhaustion, the pilot intentionally crash landed with the landing gear retracted

					The bomber flew to Marysville, CA, where it refueled and took off again for the over-water
					leg of the mission above the Pacific Ocean. It was to proceed to Eugene, OR, and then
					return to Marysville. In the afternoon, weather became poor in the area, and the last
					radio contact was somewhere over Oregon. When the bomber failed to return to
					Marysville, a search mission was launched over sea and land. No trace of the aircraft
					was found, and it was presumed lost at sea. Wreckage of the B-17F was found on
					Leech Lake Mountain, northeast of Covelo, CA on 10Aug43. It appeared that the bomber
					had hit about 200 feet below the summit while flying in poor visibility conditions.
					All six crew members had been killed.

					Named.SHORT SNORTER III. Named after the good luck charm that members of the 'Grand Order
					of the Short Snorter' - an elite group of inter-war air travelers who had made transoceanic
					air crossings - all carried. {first combat mission 27Feb43}. Battle damaged on a mission
					to the railway marshalling yards at Hamm, Germany 4Mar43. The weather was bad from
					takeoff through to Germany preventing four other groups rendezvousing with the 91st Bomb
					Group which proceeded alone to the target. Sixteen planes faced the toughest fighter
					defence of the war, the heaviest flak areas, and on the deepest penetration yet into Germany.
					The reception was immediate with German fighters determined to stop the attack; the
					return flight home was no easier, flying into the wind of a strong jetstream. Failed to return
					from a mission to the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory at Bremen, Germany 17Apr43 (2KIA:6MIA:2POW).
					The plane made it through fighter attacks and flak to the target without being hit. On the way
					back to the coast, however, the bomber was badly damaged by enemy fighters.
					Claimed by Oberleutnant Walter Borchers of the 8./NJG 3, detached to the IV./NJG 1,
					flying a Bf 110 G-4 from Leeuwarden airfield, the Netherlands. As the aircraft passed three
					miles east of Emden, it took direct flak hits that knocked out the No.3 engine and set the No.4
					engine on fire. Almost immediately after the pilot had feathered the No.3 propeller,
					another anti-aircraft shell burst in the cockpit, killing both pilots. Additional flak was
					soon striking the bomber. it began to lose altitude, circling slowly downward in the direction
					of Norden and the North Sea. Crashed in the North Sea, eleven miles northwest of the Isle of
					Norderney, Germany. {10 missions) MACR 16090

					and proceeded to a secondary target at Nis, Yugoslavia. After going 80 to 100 miles beyond

					 Crashed on the ferry flight from Marrakech to Biskra 3Jan43 (9POW). The plane was in a flight of three
					which were detailed to join the 97th Bomb Group; problem was, no-one told the Bomb Group to
					expect the flight. They found themselves over a solid undercast, preventing visual navigation and the
					airfield at Biskra did not respond to any radio calls. Dropping down, they realised they were over the
					enemy territory of Tunisia. Two of the planes were attacked by German fighters, one crash landing
					and this plane force landing in the desert near Gabès, Tunisia. Intending to force land alongside, the
					pilot of the third plane aborted when the crew fired a red flare; they had landed in enemy territory.
					Before a takeoff could be attempted the next morning, the crew and plane were captured and taken
					prisoners of war. Two pilots of 58th Fighter Squadron, 33rd Fighter Group were flying a patrol over
					enemy-held territory between Gabès and El Guettar 5Jan43. They spotted an apparently undamaged B-17
					being towed along a road. Captured by the Germans, the aeroplane was being towed towards a Luftwaffe
					base when the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk pilots found it. The two pilots did not like the idea of the B-17
					falling into enemy hands, so they dove down and strafed the bomber until it caught fire and burned to a hulk. .

					Named WAR BRIDE -art work on right side of nose / OLD FAITHFUL - on left side of nose.
					 Artwork of a reclining nude woman. Battle damaged on a mission to the railway marshalling yards
					at Hamm, Germany 4Feb43. Cloud cover prevented bombing of the primary target at Hamm and the
					formation diverted to the industrial area of Emden, Germany. The bomber suffered a direct hit
					from Fw 190 cannon fire shortly after the aircraft had dropped its bombs. The bombardier was
					manning his guns as fighters were coming in from all angles. His 45-caliber pistol was resting
					on a shelf just above his left shoulder. There was a terrific explosion directly beside his head,
					stunning him for a moment. When he regained his composure, he decided to find out what
					happened and immediately spotted what was left of his pistol. A 20mm shell from the Fw 190 had
					made a direct hit on the hammer of the pistol. The hit tore the grip from the right side of the gun
					butt and tore the gun holster apart. The gun slide was dented and nicked. Shrapnel from the shell
					almost tore the nose compartment apart. The bomb sight gyro was pierced. The parachute the
					bombardier was wearing on his back was torn to ribbons. With all the damage the shell had done, t
					he bombardier and the navigator were untouched. There was no doubt that the 45-caliber pistol
					saved the life of the bombardier by deflecting the shrapnel. A 20mm shell exploded in the vertical s
					tabiliser of the B-17, tearing it apart. All told, about twenty shells entered the plane which returned
					safely to Molesworth. Battle damaged on a mission to the power station supplying the naval
					installations at Lorient, France 16Apr43. No.1 and 3 engines were running rough and the aircraft
					was out of formation. No.2 engine caught fire but was extinguished and the right wing damaged by
					an enemy fighter. The plane force landed at RAF Predannack, Cornwall. Failed to return from a mission
					to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 manufacturing factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44 (1KIA:9POW).
					While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and a recall signal was
					issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target.
					This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support
					was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target.
					P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal support but they obeyed the recall order to return to
					England and left the bombers to fend for themselves on the return trip. It proved to be the most disastrous
					of the 303rd Bomb Group combat missions flown to date. The 303rd lost eleven of the forty B-17s
					flying the mission. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when the American
					fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run, with
					intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. It was shot down by German fighters, peeled out
					of formation and was last seen at 17,000ft under control. The crew bailed out over Goslar before
					the plane crashed two hundred meters south of Horn, Kreis Lippe. {35 missions} MACR 1926

					bombing alongside the RAF and operated night leaflet and propaganda missions. Collision with RAF
					Beaufighter V8715 (2KIS); crashed at Foulsham, Norfolk 31Aug43 (8KIS:2RTD). The Beaufighter was evidently
					in a steep bank to the right hitting the B-17 between the No.3 and No.4 engines from the front. The force of the collision
					split the Beaufighter in half and severed the right wing of the B-17F. The two waist gunners parachuted to safety.
					The bomber crashed into a farm building on the Parish Church Farm on the southern edge of the town of
					Foulsham, Norfolk, killing nine other crew members including a Royal Air Force pilot on detached service
					with the 305th Bomb Group from Royal Air Force No.3 Group, advising how to fly at night, riding as Observer.
					There were no civilian casualties. The farm building was partially demolished, killing five bullocks.
					Under the 'Conclusions And Recommendations' of the subsequent investigation it was noted that both aircraft
					were flying without navigation lights as they were above 5,000ft and there was a 'Red' air raid alert on
					at that time. The accident was unavoidable. The Beaufighter crashed at Foulsham, England.

					heavy flak fired from navy flak boats fragmented the group. German fighters arrived on the
					scene, quickly exploited the situation and began concerted attacks. A Fw 190 fired at the

					lines with his hands to stop the flow and fire. The radio operator was wounded and the ball
					turret was destroyed, injuring the gunner. No.3 propeller oversped, the No.2 supercharger
					was shot out and the No.3 fuel tank was leaking. The aileron and elevator controls and

					Shot down by enemy action before reaching the target. A Me 410 fired a rocket which damaged No.3
					engine and sheared 3ft off the top of the vertical stabiliser, injuring the tail gunner. Attacks by Fw 190s
					resulted in a runaway propeller on No.1 engine and damaged No.2 engine; the electrical system was
					disabled and a fire started in a wing. The pilot dived the bomber to try and extinguish the fire and
					managed to escape further attacks by entering a cloud layer. Attempts to jettison the bombs failed
					and the fire had spread to the fuselage. At this point the crew started to bail out. The bomber was
					now at 4,000ft and exploded before all the crew could escape. The aircraft crashed at Doehren,
					near Melle, eighteen miles southeast of Osnabrück, Germany. {21 missions.

					The group formation passed over Cromer, Norfolk, at 1,000ft trying to fly under German radar.
					Unfortunately, they were spotted by the Bremen defense area and fighters were vectored along
					the Danish coast on an interception course. The formation reached 11,000ft, found the target
					and released their bombs. Then the group was intercepted over Kiel, Germany, by a force of Fw 190s.
					Numerous 20mm cannon shells struck in the cockpit area of ??the B-17. Numerous other shells hit the
					right side of the fuselage and elevator controls; the rudder had also been damaged. Shortly afterwards,
					a heavy explosion rocked the plane. A missile hit the right wing. An explosive bullet penetrated the
					windshield, Plexiglass and aluminum parts penetrated the cockpit area. The explosion showered the
					pilot with parts of the windshield. For a while he couldn't see anything because his eyes were covered
					with blood. Missiles again damaged the right wing behind engine number 4. The aileron had already
					been torn away; this caused the aircraft to steer into a right turn. The B-17 spiralled downwards out
					of formation. The pilot and co-pilot struggled with the spinning aircraft and managed to straighten
					it up. The radio operator had been hit by a cannon shell but still sent out a distress signal, then
					clamped the transmitter key down and returned to his gun. The pilot warned the crew to take up crash
					positions and wait for the impact. He managed to fly the plane straight and level, putting the B-17
					down amongst horses and cattle grazing on salt marshes at Kalifornien, near Schonberg, eleven miles
					northeast of Kiel, Germany without further injuries to the crew. The radio operator had died from his
					wounds before the crash. {19 missions}. damaged by Hptm Erich Woitke in Fw 190A-6 of JG 11/2

					was subject to continuous fighter attacks from the time it crossed over the enemy coast. In addition,
					the bombers were hit by flak as they passed over anti-aircraft defence zones. This plane was
					struck by flak over the Luftwaffe airfield at Woensdrecht, Netherlands, disabling No.4 engine.
					An 88mm shell went up through the engine, not exploding until several hundred feet above the
					aircraft. But, it took out the engine as it passed through. Soon afterwards, a Bf 109 came in
					disabling the No.1 engine. Another 88mm shell came up through the fuselage directly behind
					the pilots' seat, exiting in front of the top turret position, cutting control cables as it passed
					through the bomber. The pilot set the autopilot but that did no good, the plane was wallowing
					along in the sky. A 20mm cannon shell had struck the top turret, wounding the gunner. Unfortunately,
					the top turret mechanism was frozen in a position such that no one could get past it. During one
					of the fighter passes, the oxygen line to the ball turret was shot out and the gunner died from anoxia.
					The pilot saw that they had no control over the plane, decided to bail out and attempted to advise
					the crew. The bomber snapped upward out of the formation and half fell into a tight spin, the spin
					becoming tighter and tighter as it fell to the ground. Crashed in a forest west of Hergarten,
					twelve miles south of Düren, Germany. The aircraft broke up upon impact but its bombs, still aboard,
					did not explode and despite the fuel aboard there was only a small fire. The tail section, along with
					the gunner's compartment, broke off and came to rest some 330 yards from the main wreckage. {23 missions}.

					Crashed seven miles northwest Pyote Field, TX 2Feb43. The aircraft took off to fly the
					airline beams to Albuquerque AAB, NM when there was a fog blanket of 1500 feet.
					The Tower told the crew they could fly above it and when they were due to come back
					early the next morning there would be a cloud ceiling of 1000 feet. The aircraft
					arrived back the next morning with dense fog below. The Tower told the crew to
					do a procedure let down and turn around on the beam, which they did.
					When they got down to 1000 feet they were still in dense fog so decided to let
					down to 500 feet as that country is very flat and there were lots of gas flares burning
					from the local gas wells which the crew thought they would be able to see easily at 500 feet.
					They let down to 500 feet and did not see any flares and were just starting to pull up
					when the aircraft hit the ground. It plowed along the ground, all the propellers had hit
					and become deformed, the number three engine was torn off the wing, and wind milled
					through the tail of the plane. The plane had cracked and bent behind the bomb bay and
					the fuel line to the torn away engine was spewing gasoline on the ground near the plane.
					The crew opened the window on the left side of the cockpit and those in the front climbed out
					that window. The rest of the crew went out through the door in the rear of the fuselage. Salvaged 3Feb43.

					Named "Cat O'9 Tails" Sustained flak damage on a mission to the ball bearing factories at
					Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43 (10RTD). En route to the target area, the bomber formation was
					repeatedly attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters. After the target, the Group turned and
					headed westward for England. German fighters, having landed and refueled, attacked again until,
					finally, the bombers reached the coastline of western Europe and relative safety. The pilot found
					Molesworth covered by fog and ordered his crew to bail out over Aylesbury after making several
					futile attempts to find the airfield's landing lights. The bomber was almost out of gasoline, the
					rudder controls had been shot away, the radio compass and other flight instruments were out
					and the plane was badly shot up. It crashed in the backyard of 170 High Street, Risley, Bedfordshire,
					about ten miles south of Molesworth, and broke in half after hitting a tree. Salvaged.

					Battle damaged on a mission to the Bosch magneto factory at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43. From the
					Initial Point until leaving the target area, there was a complete undercast except for small
					sparse patches of farm land. This group went over the target area twice without dropping
					their bombs. Bombs were finally dropped on Achern, a small town 18km southwest of
					Baden-Baden, Germany. Having spent too long over the target, the formation was beginning
					to realise that fuel exhaustion would likely lead to many not being able to return to base. A 20mm
					cannon shell from an enemy fighter knocked out the number one engine about 15 minutes after
					leaving the target. The plane landed back at Molesworth with the propeller feathered.

					Battle damaged on a mission to the railway

					RAF Exeter, Devon. Battle damaged on a mission to the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory at Bremen,
					Germany 17Apr43. There was heavy opposition from Luftwaffe fighters and the plane took a
					hit resulting in an engine fire. Shortly after that, the gunner almost fell out of the ball turret
					when its door opened. He was pulled back to safety, the engine fire was extinguished, and the
					plane completed the mission on only three engines. Received a field modification to counter the
					German tactic of head on attacks; the bomb sight was removed, a twin 0.50caliber gun was installed
					and armored plate to protect the gunner. Battle damaged on a mission to the Chemische Werke synthetic
					rubber works at Hüls, Marl, Germany 22Jun43. Flak over the target was intense and the Group
					encountered strong enemy fighter attacks on the way home. Battle damaged on a mission to the
					Luftwaffe airfield at Vlissingen, Netherlands 15Aug43. Cloud cover over the target caused the
					Group to divert to the secondary target, the Luftwaffe airfield at Vlissingen, Netherlands.
					Moderate accurate flak was experienced over target area. 324th Bomb Squadron.
					Named HEAVYWEIGHT ANNIHILATORS II artwork by Tony Starcer of a provocative, reclining brunette

					shadow of death, I fear no evil, for Thou art with me. Battle damaged
					on a misssion to the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt, Germany 17Aug43 (7POW:1WIA:2RTD).
					The aircraft barely escaped a forced landing in enemy territory when 15-20 miles southeast of
					Frankfurt, three 20mm shells exploded in the left wing directly under the pilots' compartment.
					A 20mm shell, which entered the nose of this aircraft, exploded and caused a fire to break out in
					the pilots' compartment. The smoke temporarily blinded the pilots. The navigator and bombardier,
					apparently fearful that the fuel tanks would blow the aircraft up, opened their escape hatch
					and jumped. By doing so the sudden rush of fresh air cleared the aircraft of smoke, and at the
					same time gave a good draft to the fires. The pilots' compartment, now clear of smoke, found the
					aircraft going down in a wide spin. The pilot managed to level off at 6,000ft. As all expected the
					aircraft to blow up, the co-pilot went aft to check the parachutes on his crew members before
					they jumped, while the top turret gunner, who was already wounded in leg and chest, fought the
					fire in the pilots' compartment. Although coolness prevailed among the crew members, there
					was a good chance of several crew members jumping without their harness being properly adjusted.
					The co-pilot returned to the pilots' compartment and found the gunner in his gun position firing on
					attacking enemy fighters, his parachute badly burned. With the co-pilot and gunner managing to
					extinguish at least fourteen fires, by now the pilot had regained control of the plane and found
					that all four engines were operating normally. He decided to try to make for home and chance
					that they would successfully fight their way through fighters and evade AA fire. The pilot brought
					the aircraft down to below 100ft so that enemy fighters could not attack from below and headed
					for England, taking evasive action. Passing at low level over Germany, the people scattered
					and fell to the ground; over Belgium the people waved and saluted the bomber. The pilot, guided
					by a large 'V for Victory' on the ground in Belgium formed by laundry laid out to dry, made a safe
					crash landing at RAF Manston, Kent. The aircraft was badly damaged with over 500 cannon shell a
					nd shrapnel holes. {17 missions}. Salvaged. MACR 283.

					Battle damaged on a mission to the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory at Bremen, Germany 17Apr43
					(1WIA:9RTD). Approaching the target, the bomber was attacked by enemy fighters disabling
					two engines and shattering the top turret. Returning home, a third engine was damaged but
					produced some power by the co-pilot using his hands to hold a broken cable. Equipment,
					ammunition and guns were thrown out to save weight as the plane skimmed the North Sea
					back to England. At tree top height, the pilot spotted the fighter base at RAF Coltishall, Norfolk.
					With only one main wheel fully extended the plane landed on the grass. Battle damaged on a
					mission to the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt, Germany 17Aug43. Force landed on
					return with No.1 engine damaged by flak at RAF Chedburgh, Bury St Edmunds. Eighth Air Force

					Channel, the bombardier was wounded by a 0.50 caliber shell fired from a plane ahead. The pilot turned back to base
					Transferred to 323BS/91BG Bassingbourn Sep 11, 1943; trannsferred to 322BS [LL-S];
					91st BG, 332nd BS, *Old Faithful*) Used for local and instrument flying.
					Battle damaged on a mission to industrial areas at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 4Oct43.
					Flak over the target was moderate and accurate. A large force of enemy fighters were encountered,
					some using rockets which were fired from a distance beyond the range of the bombers' guns.
					Struck in the wings by 20mm and 0.303 shells, nose, right waist and wings damaged by flak.
					Failed to return from a mission to the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt,
					Germany 14Oct43 (1KIA:8POW:1EVD). When the crew arrived at the aircraft they were met by the
					aircraft crew chief who informed the pilot that there must be a mistake because the aircraft
					was not Combat Ready and it had never been scheduled for combat with the 91st Bomb Group.
					He also advised the pilot that the engines on the aircraft were 'high-time' and that was a main
					concern. German fighters attacked the bomber formation both inbound and outbound from the
					coast to the target area. As the bomber approached Schweinfurt it began to encounter extremely
					intense flak. Just after bomb release over the target, the plane was hit by flak in the No.4 engine
					on the right wing. The propeller was feathered and the aircraft continued to fly in formation
					on three engines. As enemy fighters attacked the bomber formation after leaving the target area,
					the No.3 engine was hit by flak severing fuel and oil lines. The main oxygen tank was also hit
					and exploded, causing the co-pilot, currently flying the plane, to fear a 20mm cannon shell explosion
					and slumped against the control wheel. The bomber could no longer maintain altitude and began
					to fall behind the formation. Enemy fighter planes repeatedly attacked the aircraft but the crew
					continued to fight. The No.3 propeller could not be feathered and fuel was leaking from the nacelle.
					As it struggled to reach the enemy coast, engine No.1 on the left wing lost power when a couple of
					cylinders blew out and the pilot ordered the crew to bail out. Seven of the crew were able to
					successfully leave the aircraft. With the tail gunner believed to be unconscious, the pilot elected to
					try for a forced landing, helped by the navigator. As the plane began a slow, controlled spiral to the
					ground, a Ju 88 continued to attack, raking the fuselage and cockpit area with additional hits.
					The pilot managed to perform a crash landing in a clearing close to a wooded area near Nancy, France.
					MACR 899. The aircraft was repaired and used by Luftwaffe at the Luftwaffen Erprobungsstelle
					Rechlin, Germany. Operated by the Luftwaffe KG200 [code DR+PE]

					Nearing the target, the 97th Bomb Group was forced to circle to permit the 301st Bomb Group to attack
					first, as planned. During the turn the second element of three was misplaced and as the flight
					approached the assigned target it was attacked by three enemy fighters. Flak over the target struck
					and disabled No.2 and No.4 engines causing an overspeeding propeller and fire on No.2 engine.
					The plane couldn't keep up with the rest of the squadron and, falling behind, was attacked again
					by fighters. The engineer/top turret gunner was killed instantly. A fire broke out in the cockpit
					and the plane rapidly lost altitude. The bail out signal was given but the plane was too low
					for a safe evacuation. Only the bombardier managed to jump at less than 800 feet, hit the ground
					hard and helped rescue some survivors when he reached the crash site. The pilot crash landed the
					plane behind enemy lines at Sidi Ahmed airfield, west of Bizerte. The co-pilot, navigator and ball
					turret gunner were killed. Survivors managed to escape when the plane broke in two and reached
					the safety of nearby Allied front lines. Named SOONER II

					955th School Squadron, Hobbs Field, NM 22Nov42. Crashed during a training flight five miles
					south of Mineral Wells, TX near Fort Worth, TX 11Mar43. The crew was briefed to fly at 8,500
					feet to Amarillo, then Tulsa, Shreveport, turning east to Dallas and then on to Fort Worth Field,
					where they were to remain over night, returning to Hobbs Field the following day. Except for
					excessive fuel consumption and increasingly bad weather, the flight was normal until the plane
					left Shreveport. It began to pick up ice. The pitot tube froze (used to measure air speed), but pitot
					heat was turned on and the instrument came back online. The pilot lifted the plane to escape
					icing and to maintain radio contact. Rounding Shreveport, the plane turned east toward Dallas.
					Cruising at 14,000ft on the way to Dallas, they ran into large build ups of clouds and again started
					to pick up ice. They had to climb to 18,000ft to get above the icing and retain radio contact. As they
					approached Dallas, they dropped down into the overcast at 14,000ft. They maintained radio contact
					this time. When they were over Dallas Radio Station, the ceiling in Fort Worth, TX was reported at
					800 feet. Fort Worth, TX told them to descend to 3,000ft. The crew began going through their landing
					checklist while waiting clearance to make a procedure let down into Tarrant Field, Fort Worth, TX.
					The airfield reported a ceiling of 300 feet. "No go on your landing, climb to 8,000ft and head for Abilene".
					The ceiling there was supposed to be 1,000ft. As the aircraft came into Fort Worth, TX and went on
					out the north leg for procedure let down, the ceiling dropped to 300 feet and in a very little while
					it was down to 100 feet. As it was going around to make a 180 degree turn to come back onto the
					beam, the No.1 engine failed; they were at 3,000ft then. The crippled plane managed to climb to 8,000ft
					on the three remaining engines. The weather outside continued to worsen. The No.2 engine failed and
					the propeller would not feather. They attempted to contact Abilene by radio, but couldn't. They reported
					this fact to the Fort Worth, TX radio and asked for instructions but didn't get any. The pilot and co-pilot
					were unable to control the plane. They were going down. Air speed fell to 115 mph. They couldn't keep a
					compass heading. They estimated they were fifty miles from Fort Worth, TX with a ceiling no more
					than 600 800 feet. The pilot decided to abandon the airplane, eight crew bailed out safely. Salvaged 11May43.

					leaving the target area, there was a complete undercast except for small sparse patches of farm land.
					This group went over the target area twice without dropping their bombs. Bombs were finally
					dropped on Achern, a small town 18km southwest of Baden-Baden, Germany. Having spent too
					long over the target, the formation was beginning to realise that fuel exhaustion would likely
					lead to many not being able to return to base. May have been struck in the wings by flak but
					bombed the target and rallied for the return to base. Enemy fighters attacked hitting the wings
					but without serious damage. North of Paris, and low on fuel, the crew started to jettison unwanted
					equipment. The No.3 engine stopped from fuel exhaustion and the bomber dropped back
					out of formation. With the propeller feathered, two enemy fighters scored hits as the aircraft
					dropped down to 2,000ft. It crash landed in a hay field 5km southwest of Gisors, France.
					The crew set fire to and destroyed the aircraft to prevent capture by the enemy; the

					during takeoff with parked B-17F 42-29548 and 42-2987 at Gowen 13Apr43 (5KIS). The sortie
					was an instrument check ride which included a blind takeoff and the student was taking his
					first check. The B-17 started to take off with the student under the hood and an instructor
					pilot of considerable experience was sitting in the right hand seat. The airplane ran 1,550
					feet down the runway then turned off the runway under full power. It was straightened
					out momentarily while still under full power and swerved further to the right. Finally,
					after proceeding in a wide arc for approximately 3/10 of a mile from the runway,
					it hit the left wing of an airplane parked on the north side of the ramp (B-17F 42-29548).
					It swung further to the right, still under full power at an estimated speed of 70 or 80 miles an
					hour and proceeded south across the ramp. It collided with the transformers furnishing power
					to one of the main water wells on the field and smashed head-on into another parked plane
					(B-17F 42-2987). As the airplane came onto the ramp, witnesses stated that it was in a nose-down
					attitude under full power. The propellers were observed to strike the ground and the left tire
					blew out just before the airplane struck the wing of the first parked plane. At the time of the
					accident the airplane was travelling at an angle of approximately 45° or more with the
					original takeoff direction, and was swerving violently to the right. When 42-5751 collided
					head-on with 42-2987, both planes were badly damaged and fire started, without an explosion,
					which completely destroyed both planes. Four men in the airplanes were killed as a result
					of the crash; one man who was on the ramp was struck and killed by the airplane. Salvaged 27Apr43

					96th Bomb Squadron, 2nd Bomb Group, Glasgow Field, MT. On this particular day a
					three-plane vee formation was cavorting over the Dakota landscape returning from the bomb range.
					The terrain was relatively smooth and rolling, the air smooth, cruising along, nice and tight,
					propellers clearing the sagebrush by maybe ten feet. The pilots were taken by surprise when one
					flushed a large covey of quail out of the sagebrush and the covey broke to the left into the
					path of this plane. With no room to attempt an avoidance maneuver that close to the ground,
					the pilot had no choice but to plow straight ahead into a frantic cloud of quail. The bomber
					was taking strikes in every area. The waist gunners were even reporting that several quail
					had flown in the gun ports, fluttering around in the fuselage before flying out again.
					To that point no damage had been done to the aircraft that a wash down to remove a collection
					of blood and feathers wouldn't have corrected. But he was not to be so lucky. One little
					feathered bird got caught in the propeller wash of No.2 engine. The quail entered the air
					scoop and severely damaged the air cooler for the engine. This damage immediately
					manifested itself on the appropriate cockpit instruments and the pilot shut down and
					feathered the propeller of that engine. 15th Ferrying Group, Caribbean Wing, Air Transport

					Destroyed by fire being cleaned with gasoline at Châteaudun-du-Rhumel 11May43 (1DOI).
					The airplane had developed some engine problems. The assistant crew chief was cleaning oil,
					from a bad oil leak, off of the number two engine. He was using gasoline as the cleaning fluid,
					but for reasons that are not known, he hadn't disconnected the battery. It is believed that the
					liquid gasoline shorted across the battery terminals, instantly erupted into a deadly blaze
					that severely burned the mechanic about the hands, face and shoulders, and enveloped the
					engine in fire. The 20th Squadron line chief, riding the flight line in his jeep, noticed the fire,
					drove to the scene, grabbed a fire extinguisher, and doused the blaze. The mechanic was quickly
					taken to a nearby British field hospital where he later died from his burns. {3 missions}.
					Named TURD BURD / GATHER BURD. Somewhere in the early days of their short relationship, the
					pilot [Gathercole] and the plane developed a major personality conflict. Nothing of a fatal nature,
					just a series of minor things, mostly in the area of maintenance or performance. After many unscheduled
					repair sessions, the plane returned to the flight line emblazoned with the marginally vulgar name of "TURD BURD."
					Some time later the plane was part of a flight of 96th Squadron's B-17s, along with similar units from
					Cut Bank and Lewistown, ordered to assemble at Great Falls AAB for some joint operation with the
					20th (HQ) Squadron. One of the featured attractions of the day was an open house and review of
					the Group's aircraft, which stretched for an impressive length along the flight line, by high ranking
					officers and Great Falls community leaders headed by the Mayor, his wife and 18 year old daughter.
					Since few of the training aircraft could boast a name, the Mayor's daughter was particularly thrilled
					when she, and the review, came upon the 96th's "TURD BURD." "How cute," she exclaimed, spelling it
					out, "TURD BIRD!" Embarrassed, she broke off the vocalizing of what she had just spelled and joined the
					inspection party as they hurriedly sped down the runway to where less adorned B-17s awaited them.
					Orders were soon cut and on their way through channels to get that "expletives deleted" name off
					that "expletives deleted" aircraft

					a mission to the Steyr-Daimler-Puch factory complex at Steyr, Austria 24Feb44 (1WIA:9RTD).
					The mission was a most disastrous day for the 2nd Bomb Group, losing fourteen aircraft to enemy
					fighters. Fighters started attacking the Group about five miles north of Fiume, Italy and continued
					for one hour. The radio operator was wounded by a 20mm cannon shell. Failed to return from a
					tactical mission against German troop concentrations and defensive positions at Albano Laziale,
					Rome, Italy 2Mar44 (2MIA:9RTD). Struck by flak several times causing the No.3 and 4 propellers
					to overspeed. The nose compartment was struck and partially blown away and there were numerous
					holes in the right wing and waist area. Having lost the engine oil, the two propellers could not be
					feathered and were causing the plane to vibrate badly. The radio room and ball turret were both
					badly damaged by flak. The crew assembled in the waist area preparing for the order to bail out.
					Still over land, the pilot delayed his order because they had just dropped fragmentation bombs
					on the enemy below and had probably killed a good many of them. Naturally those that were left
					wouldn't have been very friendly to the crew coming down on top of them. One over water,
					the plane was ditched in the Tyrrhenian Sea near the island of Ponza, the wings broke off and the
					plane quickly sank. The crew was spotted by a RAF Wellington bomber and picked up by a
					British Air-Sea Rescue boat after four hours in the dinghy. {86 missions}. MACR 3216.

					mission to the submarine base at Saint-Nazaire, France 1May43 (6KIA:3POW). Departing on the
					mission, the No.3 engine was running rough. As the formation left England at Portland Bill, Dorset
					to cross the English Channel, the engine became more and more defective and the plane lost speed,
					struggling to keep pace with the squadron. With a strong headwind, the aircraft had dropped behind
					the formation before reaching the target and the No.3 propeller had been feathered. The bomb
					load was jettisoned then the aircraft was attacked by German Fw 190 fighters of Gruppe III / JG 2 'Richthofen'.
					The electrical system and intercom were disabled. Cannon shells destroyed the radio; the
					instrument panel began to smoke before exploding into flames, quickly filling the front of the
					aircraft with toxic smoke. The pilot was collapsed in his seat with another engine on fire.
					Some of the crew had bailed out while others continued to fire back at the fighters; they would
					later be trapped but were thrown out when the aircraft exploded. The bomber had been shot
					down by Unteroffizier Rudolf Gehrhardt of 9./JG 2 and crashed at Les Morandières, west of
					Saint-Père-en-Retz, southeast of Saint-Nazaire, France.

					Command (AFSC), 8Apr43. . 401st Bomb Squadron [LL*B], 91st Bomb Group, Bassingbourn (Station 121),
					Cambridgeshire 5Sep43. Named "Skoal" . Failed to return from a mission to the port at Bremen,
					Germany 26Nov43 (10RTD). The No.1 engine was struck by flak and oil was streaming out. The pilot
					tried to feather the propeller but it wouldn't feather and the propeller was windmilling, shaking the
					plane violently. The pilot had to reduce speed and began slowly dropping behind the formation.
					The bombs were released over the target and the plane then made a turn towards England.
					After turning from the target the flak was still bursting everywhere, and in the distance were
					enemy fighters. The pilot and co-pilot were coaxing the remaining three engines along but still
					had to keep down airspeed because of the windmilling propeller. Flak was coming up and hit the
					right wing between the spars, just outboard of No.4 engine. About the same time No.3 engine failed.
					The pilot tried to feather No.3 propeller; it wouldn't feather but fortunately it finally stopped turning.
					At the same time, the plane was attacked from the rear by enemy fighters. The crew shot a flare to
					call in friendly fighter escorts. A P-47 Thunderbolt came in to drive off the enemy. It had lost quite a
					lot of fuel out of tank No.4, probably from the burst that went through the right wing. The bomber had
					to cross one of the Frisian Islands and the North Sea to reach England. By this time the bomber had
					lost quite a lot of altitude and was down to about 3,000ft at the coast. The island was heavily fortified
					with flak guns. The plane must have surprised the gunners; they didn't shoot up any flak until it had
					left the coast. Finally the pilot decided they were going to ditch. The crew threw out everything loose,
					ammunition guns, radio sets, cranks, parachute, oxygen bottles, etc. The pilot made a beautiful
					landing, the plane skipped once and then stopped completely. Ditched in the North Sea off Great
					Yarmouth, Suffolk. The sea was pretty rough, the waves probably ten feet high but some of the crew
					managed to enter a life raft. As the remaining crew was trying to secure themselves, a Royal Navy
					minesweeper, HMS Eastbourne, hove into view and rescued the complete crew. {7 missions}.

					Battle damaged on a mission to the Arado Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory, Anklam,
					Prussia 9Oct43 (2WIA:8RTD). The formation was attacked by a large force of Luftwaffe
					fighters soon after it crossed the coast. They followed all the way in, attacking on the bomb
					run and over the target. Just before reaching the target, the squadron assistant operations
					officer, riding as an observer in the tail compartment, was seriously wounded; the right
					wiast gunner was also wounded. The plane was struck and badly damaged by 20mm cannon
					shells and flak; on return to base, the wing flaps did not work. 323rd Bomb Squadron [OR*R].
					Damaged on a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 manufacturing factory at Oschersleben,
					Germany 11Jan44. While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases
					and a recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division,
					continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy
					fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration
					and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal support
					but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for themselves
					on the return trip. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when the
					American fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the
					bomb run, with intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. The bomber was carrying six 500
					pound demolition bombs and a bomb bay tank full of fuel. Long before the target, No.3 engine
					was shot away and on the bomb run No.2 was shot out. The pilot let the propellers windmill
					rather than feather them and the plane held in formation with just two engines. Repeated
					attacks after bombing destroyed radio equipment, ruined the navigation compartment and
					damaged the cockpit. There was a large hole in the floor of the nose compartment. A 20mm shell
					had struck a large oxygen bottle and the resultant explosion set the cockpit ablaze, set off
					some red flares and started another fire in the nose. Without brakes, the plane landed at
					Hethel (Station 114), Norfolk, swerving off the runway to narrowly avoid a collision with a
					B-24 Liberator parked on the ground. Salvaged 21Jan44

					the railway marshalling yards at Innsbruck, Austria. En route to the target the plane received
					minor damage from flak. After the target a force of enemy fighters attacked the formation.
					This plane was riddled with cannon shells from the Plexiglas nose to the tail. No.3 engine
					caught fire and the propeller oversped; it couldn't be feathered as the oil pressure had
					dropped too far. The plane's airspeed dropped right off and was difficult to keep flying
					in a straight line. With the oxygen system disabled and a strong blast of wind from the
					broken nose, the pilot descended and thought of heading to Switzerland. There was a fire
					in the bomb bay and the fire in No.3 engine had spread and intensified as the crew was
					ordered to bail out. A Bf 109 was flying off the left wing with wheels and flaps down to stay
					with the bomber and was still firing at it. The pilot, having been trained as a fighter pilot with
					gunnery traing by Capt Barry M, Goldwater, tried to avoid the fighters cannon shells by
					diving and climbing as sharply as he could. During one of these manoeuvres, the right wing
					exploded and blew the engineer out of the nose escape hatch. The pilot, about to bail out,
					was thrown straight up against the overhead window while the nose compartment fell
					straight down. The right wing had been torn off flush with the fuselage and the fuselage
					was in two pieces, broken just forward of the ball turret. The plane was in a flat spin and
					the pilot was pinned down by centrifugal force in the flight deck. He felt a collision
					and was then bumped around. Then it went quiet and still. The tail fell in a wood with
					three gunners dead. The other half of the plane with the left wing, two engines, the nose
					and the cockpit landed on another side of the mountain, between high trees. The fire was still
					burning in the bomb bay and, seeing trees outside, the pilot exited the wreckage through the
					co-pilot's window. Crashed at Gsies, Valle di Casies, Province of Bolzano, Italy. The kill was
					claimed by Oblt. Emil Bitsch of 8./JG 3. {111 missions}. MACR 1527.

					Failed to return from a mission to railway marshalling yards at Sofia, Bulgaria 24Jan44 (4KIA:6POW).
					Over the target, the formation found it impossible to bomb and proceeded to a secondary target at
					Nis, Yugoslavia. After going 80 to 100 miles beyond Sofia, the group turned and headed
					for home base. Heavy cloud formations were encountered along the route. The pilot considered
					that the formation got in trouble because it was to go over the target at a much higher altitude,
					and that too much time was spent apparently trying to find a target of opportunity that was
					in the clear. These two factors consumed the fuel that put the formation in jeopardy. On the return
					flight, this plane was part of a three plane element that broke from the formation when the first
					squadron started to descend through a hole in the clouds. The element chose to continue
					their return to base above the overcast. It was then that the pilot glanced back and saw the
					other squadron under attack by fighters. He then tried to rejoin the first squadron formation
					and was briefly attacked by four Bf 109s which the crew fought off. The formation he rejoined
					started a steep climb to clear a cloud, causing the pilot to overrun planes above and ahead of him.
					One of his crew members reported that the plane above had its bomb bay doors open.
					The leader of the second squadron circled, jettisoned its bombs and attempted to climb above the
					overcast. When the planes jettisoned their bombs, #836 was under another plane. A bomb struck
					the wing flat, smashing it almost in two. Another bomb struck the No.2 engine and propeller,
					which was feathered, causing additional drag on that side. The wing at that time was vibrating
					at a terrifying rate, so after at least a minute flying under those conditions, the co-pilot gave the
					order to bail out. The plane was last seen thirty-two miles northnortheast of Skopje headed
					towards Italy. It crashed twenty-two miles north of Skopje, North Macedonia, Yugoslavia. {28 missions}. MACR 1993

					charger on number four engine stopped functioning and having overshot the target it was decided
					to drop the armed bombs which fell in Kiel Bay. Only flying on two engines the bomber was not able
					to keep up with the formation and had to drop out. Next it was attacked by a pair of Me 210 of which
					The engineer/top turret gunner claimed one. The B-17 was now over the Baltic Sea and headed north
					towards Denmark. Soon after it was attacked by a pair of Ju 88 but after an exchange of fire they
					turned away. When the bomber reached Store Bælt it was noticed that two Ju 88`s followed them at a
					distance and at the same time flak started firing. The B-17 was hit in number three engine which
					was destroyed. It was now down to 3,500 feet heading eastwards to get out of reach of the flak.

					up five kilometres west of Kalundborg on the island of Sjælland (Sealand), Denmark.

					to mainland Italy north of Florence there was anti-aircraft fire from the ground and a few attacks
					by enemy fighters, which, however, had no effect. Most of the remaining distance was flown between
					two layers of cloud at an altitude of 6,000 meters. This bomber was flying in the 'tail end charlie' position
					at the very rear of the formation. North of the Alps, the formation encountered a deep, closed cloud
					cover that stretched far to the north. Because of a thick overcast over southern Germany, the mission
					was aborted 50km from Augsburg. The formation then turned back towards Italy. In the middle of the
					reversal maneuver, about thirty German Bf 109G-6 fighters of JG 3/8 attacked and pursued them southwards.
					Without realizing it, the Americans flew over Switzerland near Lake Constance under constant fire. In these
					attacks, this plane lost number one engine. The formation approached the Sargans valley at an altitude
					of 3,500 meters. Here the fog had cleared, the Swiss Flab Det 21 stationed in Bad Ragaz was on alert
					and observed the approach of the formation. At that time, the Swiss anti-aircraft defense had the task
					of shooting at foreign formations of more than three aircraft. While overflying their position, the
					command aircraft of the left squadron was targeted. Only about 50 meters from this plane, B-17F 42-30126
					was brought down with a direct hit. The air defense also observed hits on this B-17. After flying over
					Bad Ragaz, the formation moved on towards Chur. Under the attacks of the German fighters, it was
					not long before engines number two and three were also put out of action. With only one remaining
					engine, the aircraft could hardly be controlled and rapidly lost altitude. Almost nothing worked on
					board, and fires had broken out in two places. In this hopeless situation the pilot had no choice
					but to give the order to bail out. After five men jumped out, the plane exploded in mid-air. Parts
					fell widely scattered in the mountain area of ??the municipality of Alvaneu, 21km SSE of Chur, Switzerland.
					Observers reported that the German fighters then turned away and disappeared in the direction of Austria.

					Chemische Werke synthetic rubber works at Hüls, Marl, Germany 22Jun43 (10POW). Flak damaged and
					crashed in a polder at Rietveld, near Schelluinen, Netherlands. Not long after takeoff the pilot notices
					that there is an oxygen leak and due to the dangerous nature of such a problem he decides to return
					to base where a team is waiting to fix the problem. As the rest of the squadron flies on the aircraft
					lands and only has ten minutes to have the leak repaired, any longer and they cannot catch up the
					formation heading towards Germany. Ten minutes pass and the navigator indicates that it is now
					too late, however the base commander insists that they have to go even if it would mean flying to
					target alone which was a daunting prospect without any protection of the formation. After the leak
					was fixed the plane took off and flew maximum speed to catch up with the other B-17's. Eventually
					the target was reached only a few minutes after the main formation that had already dropped their
					bombs or were in the process of doing so. Aircraft 42-5877 dropped its bombs, turned and headed
					west towards the North Sea and the base in England. Whilst heading back the formation is attacked
					by German Focke-Wulf planes and is under constant threat of German Flak. Various planes are hit
					and then aircraft 42-5877 is hit in engine number 4. The pilot switches off the engine and feathers
					the propeller. Because of this the speed decreases and the bomber is forced to leave the formation
					together with another damaged B-17. Both of the B-17s now form an easy target for German fighters
					and soon the accompanying B-17 disappears after a German attack. [This is probably the B-17 which
					crashed at Opheusden in the Netherlands]. Aircraft 42-5877 and crew are now on their own. The B-17
					is approaching the town of Tiel and is under constant attack from German fighters. The tail gunner
					is hit multiple times but still manages to shoot down at least one German plane. The plane now
					flies over the town of Leerdam and is losing altitude when a Messerschmitt Bf 109 carries out another
					attack. The right wing is on fire and the altitude is 1500ft when they approach the town of Gorinchem.
					The pilot sounds the bail out alarm after which he makes a turn to prevent the B-17 to crash on the
					town of Gorinchem. Most of the crew land in or around Gorinchem. The plane narrowly misses a
					house and crashes in a field nearby

					Named SACK TIME / ROGER WILCO. The aircraft was named and painted by a Disney artist [the crew's ball turret gunner]
					at Bangor while waiting for maintenance and weather to clear. It was named for the captain's cocker spaniel dog
					'Roger Wilco' which had become part of the crew during training, flying on missions which didn't require oxygen.
					The dog's name and his picture were painted in the code letter Q. The aircraft was named 'Sack Time'
					because the dog spent most of its time asleep, either in the bomber or the officer's quarters. Roger was
					smuggled back to the US by a crew member who had been grounded sick on the day of the crash and
					Roger was later reunited with his owner after release from prison camp. Failed to return from a shuttle mission

					Battle damaged on a mission to the Gerhard Fieseler Werke (GFW) aircraft works at Waldau,
					Kassel, Germany 30Jul43 (10RTD). A large force of enemy fighters was encountered along
					the route from the Dutch coast to the target and out, but broke off the attacks over the
					target area. Flak was moderate over the route, but intense and accurate over the target.
					Further flak was encountered on return over Antwerp. Failed to return from a mission
					to the Bosch magneto factory at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43 (2KIA:8POW). From the Initial
					Point until leaving the target area, there was a complete undercast except for small
					sparse patches of farm land. This group went over the target area twice without dropping
					their bombs because of the loss of the target-marking plane of the squadron. With bad weather
					over Germany, the bomber attempted to attack a secondary target of a Luftwaffe air base to the
					southwest of Strasbourg, France. Failing again to find the target, the bombs were jettisoned
					into the Black Forest. Damaged by flak and attacked hard by enemy fighters.
					Shot down by Major Thimmig flying a Bf 110G of night fighter-wing NJG 101. The first bomber
					group the German pilot saw was in a fairly loose formation with two planes lagging behind.
					The German tried hard to reach a position to attack the last plane of that group, but he could only
					slowly decrease his distance to that plane, because it made an effort to catch up with its own group
					at high speed. When only 500-600 meters was left between the fighter and the bomber,
					the pilot saw himself in a position to attack and started the attack. After a number of bursts
					from a distance of 200 meter to 30 meter aiming at the fuselage and engines, both of the right
					wing engines caught fire. The burning plane turned down and tried to escape heading for
					Switzerland. The engineer/top turret gunner had been fatally wounded by the attack.
					Major Thimmig and his navigator now chased the burning plane and attacked it twice over
					the city of Ulm, pushing it away from its escape course. The pilot of the bomber realized the
					situation was futile, decided to abandon the plane and gave the order to bail out over Ulm.
					The radio operator remained, took the pilots seat and flew the still burning bomber from Ulm
					up the valley of the river Blau towards Stubersheim. He circled Weiler ober Helfenstein (a small number of farms)
					2-3 times looking for an appropriate place to land and approached in an flat angle with the landing gear down.
					Doing this, he did not see a mound two meters high. The landing gear broke off, the plane hit the ground hard and
					slid over the meadow. In the crash landing, the radio operator's head was thrown against the cockpit windscreen
					and caused severe fatal head injuries. Crash landed east of Weiler bei Helfenstein, Geislingen, Germany,
					heading for Switzerland. {6 missions} Also credited to Hptm Werner Schroer in Bf 109G-6

					Foggia #7, Amendola, Italy 16Jan44. Failed to return from a mission to the oil refineries at Ploe?ti,

					northeast of Plovdiv, Bulgaria (seven civilians were killed when the bomber crashed). The crew was
					tasked to attack the Dacia Oil Refinery at Ploe?ti. Flak struck the right wing, damaging control surfaces,
					dislodged a fuel tank and knocking out an engine which slowed it down coming over the target, losing
					altitude as the B-17 faltered and fell farther behind the formation. But still they continued and
					dropped their bombs. Then it was the Bf 109 fighters pressing in after the flak let up, with their
					20mm cannons and machine guns. The heavy bomber crew fought back, knocking down a couple
					of the fighters, but were unable to stop others inflicting more damage, taking out another engine.
					The enemy fighters had wounded the tail gunner, peppering his right arm, shoulder, head and
					parachute with shell fragments; he then crawled forward to where the waist gunners were at.
					They helped as best they could while still looking out for fighters but could not stem his bleeding
					and soon called the bombardier to help. With his primary job on the mission completed, Lt. Kingsley
					moved aft on the B-17 from the nose compartment to the waist gunner area and then dragged the
					wounded tail gunner forward to the radio room and there tended to his wounds. By now the bomber
					was a shambles with control surfaces damaged, some engines knocked out, and a wounded gunner.
					After escaping the defenses of Ploe?ti, the bomber crossed from Rumania into Bulgaria. But their
					ordeal continued as they were hit by a mix of eight German and Bulgarian Bf 109 fighter aircraft.
					The bomber had strayed off course and was flying low and slow over a Messerschmitt training
					base at Karlove, Bulgaria. The ball turret gunner was wounded and clambered up out of his turret
					and proceeded to the radio room where Kingsley also helped him. When the new waves of fighter
					attacks damaged a third engine, the pilot knew the aircraft could not fly much longer and made the
					decision to abandon the bomber. He lowered the landing gear, a signal to the enemy fighters that
					it would fight no more, and then sounded the bail out alarm. Four crew members, waist gunners,
					ball turret gunner and radioman, bailed out of the entry door in the waist section; pilot, co-pilot and
					navigator out the escape hatch in the bottom of the bomber's nose, while the flight engineer jumped
					out through the bomb bay past the opened doors. In the radio room, Kingsley realized the wounded
					tail gunner urgently needed a good parachute and without hesitation, unstrapped his own and put
					it on him, then helped the wounded gunner, who was too weak to bail out unaided, exit the plane
					through the bomb bay doors. The last sight of Kingsley was as he stood on the bomb door while
					the plane flew on auto pilot until it crashed. Named O PISSONYA MACR 6406
					In a further tragedy, the mortally wounded B-17, by now out of control, departed from any controlled
					flight and plunged to the ground. A Bulgarian family was working in the vineyards below. They
					sighted the bomber approaching as the crew bailed out and the aircraft passed over them,
					only to reverse course back towards them and fall earthward where they were standing. A mother,
					her young son, infant daughter and four other extended family members were killed as the bomber
					crashed and exploded.
					The bombardier, David Richard Kingsley, gave his parachute to a severely wounded crew member
					and was killed when the bomber crashed. Kingsley was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor,
					and Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Oregon, is named in his honor. With the base still in use by the
					Oregon Air National Guard, the 173rd Fighter Wing has repainted McDonnell Douglas F-15C Eagle
					78-0542 as a 'heritage jet' in a Flying Fortress paint scheme representing the crew's main aircraft
					'Sandman' [42-30333]; the Eagle was unveiled 10Jan20.

					Crashed after a mid-air collision with B-17F 41-24621 over the Gulf of Mexico, forty miles southeast
					of Galveston Field, TX 10Sep43 (11MIS). The planes were part of a formation on a training mission
					which had flown to the Mississippi delta where there was a bombing range and dropped 100 pound
					practice bombs. After dropping the bombs, they continued out over the Gulf to practice
					gunnery by firing at a towed target. Another plane was flying the diamond position, which was
					the leader position of the second echelon, with two wing men on the bombing run. After leaving
					the target, the instructor who was flying on the left wing, called and asked the pilot to drop
					back and let them take the diamond position and to reform on his left wing. Shortly after he made
					the formation change, the pilot of #031, who was flying right wing in the first echelon, for some
					reason lost control of his airplane, dropped back and down and its propellers cut through the
					cockpit of #621. Both airplanes came apart and both sank immediately afterwards. Only a few
					parachutes were seen; no survivors were recovered. SOC 11Sep43.11 on each aircraft killed.

					{first combat mission 23Sep43}. Severely battle damaged on a mission to railway installations at Münster, Germany 10Oct43.
					As they approached the city, the formation was swarmed by a large force of enemy aircraft for an estimated
					forty-five minutes of vicious fighting. By the time their friendly fighter escorts arrived to drive off the
					Luftwaffe, the damage had already been done. With two engines disabled, the intercom and the
					oxygen system non-functional, and with a large ragged hole in the left wing, the aircraft was landed
					safely on return to base. (this was the only one out of thirteen 100BG B-17s to return to base from this mission).

					612th Bomb Squadron, 401st Bomb Group, Great Falls AAB, MT. Crashed while practising
					bombing runs in formation two miles east of Big Sandy, MT 1Oct43 (9KIS). Crash investigators
					speculated that the pilot had finished his bombing run at an altitude of 20,000ft, then
					turned into a half roll, and the effect of the four engines racing and gravity made it
					increasing difficult to pull up. At about 475 miles per hour, the maneuver would have
					exceeded the stress limits of the airframe. Pulling the B-17 level at 7,000ft snapped off
					the wings and flipped the fuselage end over end, leading to the fatal crash on the prairie below.

				6256 Delivered to USAAF 28Nov43. Assigned to 462nd Bomb Group, Walker AAF, KS
					Departed Walker AAF, KS for CBI 14Apr44. (462nd BG, 771st BS, "Ramp Tramp") The aircraft was part
					of a 100 aircraft raid against the Japanese Showa steel mill in Anshan, Manchuria. An engine failed
					and the propeller could not be feathered so the aircraft diverted to Vladivostok, Russia Jul 29, 1944. MACR 7178..
					The interned crew was allowed to "escape" into American-occupied Iran in January 1945. The aircraft was
					not returned to the Americans and instead used by the Russians in the Tu-4 Bull development effort.
					The aircraft was flown to a base near Romanovka, Russia 9Jan45 for initial test flights by Russian pilots.
					Later, Tupolev sent it to the AF flight test center at Zhukovskiy.
					Transferred to the Soviet AF 1Jul45. Assigned to 890th Air Regiment at Orsha. This special unit
					boasted the greatest number of pilots with flight experience in U.S. aircraft, and its fleet included
					19 B-25s, 12 B-17s (F and G models), and one B-24. Later the aircraft was refitted with Shvetsov ASh-73TK
					engines, the Soviet clone of earlier Wright engine designs that had been acquired under license and for
					which parts were available. Ramp Tramp flew for nearly a decade, and soon acquired a legendary status
					among bomber crews as the progenitor of the Soviet strategic air arm in the early years of the cold war.
					Many Soviet bomber pilots in the early stages of the Tu-4 program took enormous pride in the fact that
					their flight log included hours on the Superfortress from Wichita.
					Later used as mother ship for underwing launching of Samolet 346P glider
					a development of ex-German DFS 346 rocket-powered aircraft in 1948-49. Ramp Tramp was becoming increasingly
					difficult to maintain. By 1954, the Tu-4 fleet was gradually being dismantled, and the U.S. bomber was
					scrapped along with it.

					61st Troop Carrier Group, Ninth Air Force, Barkston Heath (Station 483) Dec44. Moments after take-off from Barkston-Heath on a
					proficiency flight 18Dec44, there was a mid-air collision with C-109 #42-51766. Soon after the B-24 took off the C-109
					appeared in close formation, apparently as a lark. As the B-24 started a left turn away from the airfield, still at only 400ft,
					it lost sight of the C-109. The C-109 pilot must have mis-judged his next manoeuvre as his aircraft's vertical stabilisers
					hit the propellers on numbers 1 & 2 engines of the B-24 as they were approaching Carlton Scroop. Meanwhile the B-24 was in a
					steepening left turn, having had lost the propellers on both the left engines. The pilot tried to return to the airfield,
					but it was short of power and on fire, with the rudder surfaces burning away, making it increasing hard to control.
					At only 200ft, losing height and heading towards buildings on the base, they opted to crash land in an open field instead.
					But as they cleared a row of trees they saw a thatched building dead ahead. As they eased off the rudder to avoid the building
					the aircraft stalled and the left wing dug into the ground, tearing the aircraft apart and killing two of the five aboard,
					one of whom was the 14th TCS commanding officer.

					"Carter's Lil' Pill" [after the popular regularity medicine named Carter's Little Liver Pills]
					[Pilot William O. Carter Jr]. Force landed in Lake Iraguma, NW of Port Moresby, New Guinea October 1, 1943.
					Pilot survived and was rescued. On October 1, 1943 the fighter took off from Port Moresby;
					during the flight, the oil pump failed, causing the engine to seize. The pilot made a wheels
					up landing roughly 18 miles northwest of Port Moresby at Lake Iraguma near the Waigani Swamp.
					The aircraft was virtually undamaged during the force landing. During 1965 to 1968, Bill Champan
					decided to salvage this P-47. He began by clearing a track to the wreck, to allow access. The
					P-47 was lifted onto a trailer flatbed then towed out by a bulldozer. Due to the wet seasons and
					difficulty transporting it, the aircraft was cut into five sections and moved by hand onto dry land,
					then transported to Port Moresby. After salvage, the P-47 was stored at the South Pacific Motor
					Sports Club (SPMSC) in Port Moresby then outside at The Air Museum of New Guinea (AMPNG) until
					the early 1970s. The AMPNG attempted restoration but very little substantial work was done.
					The remains languished, firstly in a holding yard owned by a local car dealership, and then
					behind the local car club without any security. Then along came the Museum of Transport and
					Technology in Auckland, New Zealand. A deal was hatched, and the remains were shipped to
					New Zealand in about 1970-1972. During the early 1970s, the P-47 was transported to New Zealand on
					loan to the Museum of Transport and Technology (MoTAT). The museum attempted some external restoration
					of the aircraft for static display. Until 1991, this P-47 was displayed outdoors until MoTAT swapped
					this aircraft to the RNZAF Museum in exchange for restoration work done on their Mosquito.
					Until 1995, the P-47 was stored disassembled inside the RNZAF Weedons facility. During 1995, the P-47
					was swapped or sold to Robert Greinert, Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) for a new built
					Sopwith Camel that included some original parts. The P-47 was transported as air freight aboard a
					RNZAF C-130 to Sydney Airport then transported to HARS at Sydney Airport (Mascot).
					During the late 1990s, Robert Greinert began to restore this P-47 with plans to make it airworthy.
					During 2000 to 2004, this aircraft was under restoration by Peter Salmon and volunteer labor from HARS.
					Around 2010, this aircraft was transported to HARS at Albion Park Airfield, Illawarra and placed on
					public display. Around this time, a new built tail group was attached to the fuselage.
					As of April 2012, this aircraft was no longer on public display at Albion Park; restoration work continues.

				10827 99th Fighter Squadron, 33rd Fighter Group, Licata South, Sicily Sep43. When it moved on, the squadron left the fighter
					because they apparently could not get it in flying condition. A couple of 53rd TCS glider pilots tinkered around with it,
					trying to get it to run. Repaired by 46th Service Squadron, 34th Service Group. A glider pilot from the 53rd Troop Carrier
					Squadron, 61st Troop Carrier Group undertook to fly the aircraft 2Oct43. He was not rated or trained for P-40 flying,
					nor did he have anyone's approval to try flying it; the unauthorized flying was pure misconduct. He took off and
					buzzed the field and tent area repeatedly (with the P-40 landing gear down) for about half an hour distracting everybody,
					and at last buzzed too low over the 53rd TCS tent area, pulled up and stalled. He hit several almond trees and the tip of a
					tent pole, left wing tip and fragments of plane and trees, barely cleared the mess tents, orderly room tent,
					and crashed a hundred yards farther on. The plane was completely wrecked; the engine left its mounts and bounced
					100-feet beyond the rest of the wreck between tents of the 61st TCG area. The engine cut some tent ropes and just missed
					some men in the tent. The unfortunate glider pilot was rushed to the hospital but was dead a few hours later.
					Miraculously no one else was hurt; the whole business of the crash took place in an area crowded with tents and men.
