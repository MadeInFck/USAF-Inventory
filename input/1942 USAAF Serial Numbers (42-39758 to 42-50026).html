					325th Bomb Squadron [NV*K], 92nd Bomb Group, Podington (Station 109), Bedfordshire 2Dec43.
					Named "Sky Scrapper". Failed to return from a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 manufacturing
					factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44 (10POW). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather
					closed in over English bases and a recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander
					of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater
					exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on
					the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal
					support but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for
					themselves on the return trip. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified
					when the American fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced
					on the bomb run, with intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. Shot down by enemy fighters,
					crashed Kotte Farm, Almelo, near Albergen, Netherlands. MACR 1921

					had all the hallmarks of a classic. In a rematch of the previous year's antagonists, the St. Louis
					Cardinals would attempt to repeat their resounding win over the New York Yankees.
					The nation's war effort was gobbling up manpower at a prodigious rate. No one knew
					who might be playing ball in 1944, or if there would even be a 1944 season. It looked
					as if this might be the last great series for the duration of the war, which is why the first
					game drew over 68,000 fans to Yankee Stadium. On October 5, 1943, the Yankees were
					on their way to a 4-2 victory over the Cardinals when, in the eighth inning, four B-17s
					suddenly rumbled above the stadium packed with 68,676 fans. As the teams took
					batting practice and the pitchers warmed up, four Army Air Force B-17 bombers were
					droning toward New York City on their way to combat bases in England. No one is sure what
					sparked the next move. Perhaps it was just the high spirits of young men facing a dangerous
					future. As the aircraft crossed the Hudson River, the pilots headed for the Bronx and put the
					formation into a shallow dive. Picking up speed, the bombers thundered over Yankee Stadium
					in a low pass from home plate to center field. After they climbed out the B-17s wheeled about and
					circled the field while one aircraft returned for an encore. It cleared the upper-deck flagpoles
					by a mere 25 feet, prompting the Associated Press to later report that "an Army bomber roared
					over Yankee Stadium so low that Slats Martin could have fielded it". The aircraft then rejoined
					the formation and headed east. When they landed at Presque Isle airfield in Maine, the four
					pilots were confined to quarters while court martial proceedings were undertaken. They were
					released a few days later when the Army realized it was foolish to keep four badly needed aircraft
					and crews out of combat because of a youthful indiscretion. "Besides," a general told them, "you
					and your crew will probably be killed anyway". North Atlantic Wing, Air Transport Command,
					Presque Isle Field, ME 5Oct43. 358th Bomb Squadron [VK*H], 303rd Bomb Group, Molesworth (Station 107),
					 Huntingdonshire 18Oct43. Named "Thru Hel'en Hiwater" Damaged when B-17F 42-29823
					was performing a cross over maneuver to echelon in preparation for landing at Molesworth following a
					mission 9Feb44 when the number four engine/propeller contacted with the tail of B-17G 42-39785. Both
					airplanes were able to land safely and there were no casualties. Battle damaged and returned to base
					after a direct hit on the tail. The tail gunner was uninjured, fortunate that he was checking the tail wheel
					when the shell hit. 359th Bomb Squadron [BN*B]. Failed to return from a mission to the railway
					marshalling yards at Hamm, Germany 22Apr44 (4KIA:6POW). Flak set an engine on fire before the
					target, the aircraft entered a spin and exploded before some crew could bail out, crashed Delecke,

					Failed to return from a mission to the industrial area at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 29Jan44
					(5POW:4EVD:1KIA). During assembly for the mission, the plane had problems with the No.2 engine
					supercharger but the crew agreed to continue. Within sight of the target, the pilot had to
					feather the No.4 propeller because of an oil leak. The bomber could not keep up with the group,
					became a straggler and a target for enemy fighters so the crew jettisoned the bombs. The first
					wave of four Bf 109s attacked from the front and did a lot of damage even though the pilots took
					evasive action. One shell went through the nose plexiglass causing serious injury to the bombardier
					and navigator. The explosion had knocked out the oxygen system, the instrument vacuum system
					and damaged some headset communication. The pilot dove for cloud cover which was about 5,000ft.
					Utilizing the cloud cover as much as possible allowed the plane to get back over Belgium.
					There the cloud cover ran out as it flew over a large Fw 190 fighter base. They not only sent up
					fighters but fired on the bomber with small arm weapons. The combat with fighters was futile.
					The crew lost most of their gunnery protection and was receiving extensive damage to the aircraft
					along with injuries to the crew. With the rudder fabric burnt off by No.3 engine on fire, the pilot
					decided he had enough and sounded the warning bell. It had been approximately two hours since the
					first attack. A waist gunner bailed out but the remaining crew realized how low they were, estimated
					to be less than 400 feet and remained on board. Crash landed on pasture at Solre-Saint-Géry,
					south of Beaumont, Belgium MACR 2260

					The 303rd Bomb Group held a party to celebrate the 4th of July and invited a nearby Fighter Group of ‘little friends’.
					In the early hours of the following morning the little friends were in no shape to drive back to their own base.
					The Operations Officer of the bomb group used this plane as a taxi to take the fighter pilots home.
					Returning to Molesworth, on the downwind leg the pilot lowered the landing gear. The indicator light
					was missing the green cover and was too bright in the dark night so the pilot unscrewed the filament.
					On base leg, the pilot started to lower the wing flaps and expected a nice smooth landing. Unfortunately,
					he had inadvertently raised the landing gear and there wasn’t a light to warn him. His arrival at Moleworth
					was with a screech of metal and a shower of sparks as the four propellers chewed into the runway and

					Failed to return from a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 manufacturing factory at Oschersleben,
					Germany 11Jan44 (10KIA). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and a
					recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on
					to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter
					support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s
					were airborne to provide withdrawal support but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and
					left the bombers to fend for themselves on the return trip. It proved to be the most disastrous of the
					303rd Bomb Group combat missions flown to date. The 303rd lost eleven of the forty B-17s flying the
					mission. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when the American fighters
					returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run, with intermittent
					inaccurate flak on the return trip. Shot down by enemy fighters, crashed Nollman Farm, Natrup-Hagen,

					assigned to this most recent replacement, the crew chief decided he would name the
					plane after his home town in Pennsylvania: Emeigh (pronounced Amy). Artwork was
					based on an advertisement for Mojud Hosiery. Failed to return from a mission to the
					Junkers Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory at Aschersleben, Germany 22Feb44 (7KIA:3POW).
					On the way to the target, the formation met with the 381st Bomb Group. Since these planes
					were late following the main formation, no escort was available. Heavy cloud cover over
					the target forced the formation to divert to the industrial area of Bünde, Germany. The bomber
					formation was exposed to the attack of German fighters for over forty minutes without interruption,
					most of which were Fw 190s. Struck by flak the pilot was forced to feather the number one propeller.
					Almost immediately, flights of Bf 109s attacked and as the group increased speed and tightened
					their formation this plane was gradually left behind. One 500Ib bomb remained hung up in the
					bomb bay after the load was jettisoned to lighten the plane and was subjected to repeated
					attacks. Two enemy fighters came in on individual passes; the first killing the engineer,
					co-pilot and tail gunner and wounding two other crew men. As the survivors prepared to
					bail out of the waist door, the second Bf 109 attacked and killed three other airmen.
					The pilot stayed at the controls to try to keep the plane steady and give the survivors a chance
					of bailing out but just as the wounded waist gunner leaped from the waist, the plane turned over
					and went into a spin. Crashed at Hermannstal, one mile west of Lügde, six miles southwest of

					Named "Wacky Woody". Failed to return from a mission to the Messerschmitt aircraft factory at
					Regensburg, Germany 25Feb44 (10POW). The plane was being flown by a 452nd Bomb Group crew
					on loan to the 96th Bomb Group. After crossing the coastline into mainland Europe, the formation
					encountered frequent flak and fierce aerial attacks from the Luftwaffe, causing heavy damage to
					some of the bombers. Approaching Saarbrücken flak increased in intensity and accuracy. A flak shell
					burst directly under the right wing, the pilot losing control as the plane rolled with the right wing
					going up almost to the vertical. Regaining control, the two engines on the right wing had been damaged
					and the propellers were feathered. The right wing was a mess and there was fire coming out
					behind it. The pilot jettisoned the bomb load and then noticed that there was a big hole in the
					lower side of No.2 engine behind the cowl flaps. By now losing altitude rapidly, the crew bailed out.
					Crashed in fields beside the River Saar, Saarwiesen, west of Saarbrücken, Germany. MACR 2862.

					{first combat mission 26Nov43}. Battle damaged during a mission to the industrial area at Brunswick,
					Germany 10Feb44 (10RTD). Meagre to heavy flak was seen when crossing the enemy coast at IJmuiden, Netherlands.
					In the vicinity of Lingen, Germany the formation was attacked by enemy fighters in groups of three.
					As they neared the target, twin-engined aircraft fired rockets into the formation. Intense flak was
					encountered at the target where the aircraft received flak damage. The formation was under fighter
					attack until it neared the IJsselmeer on the return home. Friendly fighters were outnumbered,
					especially in the target area. Battle damaged on a mission to industrial areas in the suburbs of
					Berlin, Germany 4Mar44. Because of severe weather in the assembly area, the group diverted to a
					target in the Ruhr valley, Germany. The pilot left the formation, returned home alone and was
					attacked by enemy fighters but landed safely at Knettishall. Battle damaged on a mission to a
					railway marshalling yard at Liège, Belgium 25May44. Meagre flak was encountered crossing
					the French coast in the Le Tréport area but very accurate flak at Poix-de-Picardie, France.
					Failed to return from a mission to an oil depot at Königsburg, Germany 28May44 (10POW).
					The plane received a flak hit in the right wing shortly after the bombs were dropped over the
					target disabling No.3 and No.4 engines. The radio room was full of black smoke and a bunch
					of control cables had been shot in half. A piece of flat flak, about 18 inches long, came through the
					bottom of the right wing, through the engine, through the right fuselage, and radio room. It took the
					sight off the radio operator’s fifty-caliber machine gun and went out through the Plexiglas. The pilot
					managed to keep the badly damaged plane in the air, but could no longer maintain the necessary
					speed and altitude. The navigator reported that the plane could make it back to England with only
					two functioning engines if the propellers could be feathered. However, this was not possible
					due to the damage to this wing, so that the air resistance was too great to be able to maintain the
					altitude, even with the other two engines at full throttle. The plane had lagged behind the formation
					and, as protection from German fighter planes, the pilot called for friendly fighters to provide protection
					and two P-51 Mustangs appeared. He hoped to reach the Netherlands to find help with resistance fighters.
					The crew threw out everything that they could to lighten the aircraft but were unable to jettison the
					ball turret. The plane received some 40mm anti-aircraft fire from a town it passed over at 8,000ft.
					Still losing altitude steadily, at about 200 to 400 feet, the plane passed over an airfield and was
					fired at by 20mm anti-aircraft guns. Eventually the pilot was forced to crash land in a field near the
					Wiera river, one mile from Mengsberg, thirty-one miles southwest of Kassel, Germany. {46 missions}.
					MACR 5317. The bomber was initially camouflaged by the Germans to prevent it from being destroyed by
					American fighter planes. Then it was dismantled into transportable individual parts and transported
					away by train.

					was unable to maintain its operational committment of twice-daily meteorological reconnaissance
					sorties to the southwest over Biscay (code-named EPICURE). Such was the importance of these flights
					that the USAAF offered four B-17s to make up the shortfall - adding another four aircraft later. Initially
					these were detached to RAF St Eval and operated to the west of the UK (code-named ALLAH), but during
					the autumn it was decided the USAAF aircraft should operate from an American base - Bovingdon (Station 112),
					Hertfordshire. As the USAAF didn’t have aircrew trained in meteorological observing, the crews
					always flew with an RAF Meteorological Air Observer (MAO)

					met with the 91st Bomb Group. Since these planes were late following the main formation,
					no escort was available. Heavy cloud cover over the target forced the formation to divert to the
					industrial area of Bünde, Germany. The bomber formation was exposed to the attack of German
					fighters for over forty minutes without interruption, most of which were Fw 190s. The bomber was
					hit hard on the first wave of attacks. Engines number 2 and 3 caught fire immediately. The pilot
					pulled out of the formation and tried to extinguish the fires in the engines by diving down to an
					altitude of 3,000ft. In the process, he lost control of the aircraft, the crew was unable to escape

					site in the Pas de Calais, France 13Feb44 (1WIA:1INJ:8RTD). The plane was subjected to flak en route
					to the target with three bursts close on the right side knocking the bomber off course. Shrapnel had
					knocked out the radio communications and the No.1 engine was badly damaged and shut down; the
					propeller kept unfeathering causing additional drag. This forced the plane out of formation. The
					temperature of No.3 engine was rising and there was a strong smell of gasoline from pierced fuel tanks
					in the right wing. The bomb load was jettisoned as was excess equipment as the plane slowly descended
					over the English Channel. The plane reached the English coast and the pilot looked for a suitable airfield
					to land at. Spotting a RAF fighter airfield, the pilot force landed at RAF Detling, Kent. Landing safely
					on the wet grass field, the plane suddenly lurched then skidded left out of control and slammed into a
					concrete pillbox. The plane’s nose was crushed and the fuselage was broken. Salvaged 15Feb44

					Failed to return from a mission to railway facilities around Berlin, Germany 29Apr44 (6EVD:4POW).
					The combat wing was off course heading to Berlin, attacked by enemy fighters and bombed Magdeburg.
					The aircraft lost an engine en route to the target from flak damage and a second whilst over the target.
					The loss of two engines caused the aircraft to fall out of formation and the crew headed for home alone.
					The pilot warned the crew to prepare to bail out. A waist gunner apparently took this as the cue to
					immediately bail out from the aircraft. Shortly before crossing the Dutch border the aircraft lost a
					third engine through flak damage and with only a single serviceable engine the pilot decided to
					attempt a crash landing instead of ordering the crew to bail out. The aircraft was put down in a field
					near Lichtenvoorde, southeast of Ruurlo, Netherlands. The crew escaped with some minor injuries and
					remained long enough to try and set the aircraft ablaze before heading for a wooded area to avoid capture.
					That night they were taken in by the Dutch resistance and were sheltered prior to being dispersed throughout the resistance network

					Battle damaged during a mission to railway marshalling yards at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 4Feb44.
					As the planes were passing over the Netherlands en route to Germany, local cross winds carried the
					bombers straight into enemy flak which was heavy and accurate. The right waist section, Plexiglas
					nose and the left wing between the engines were all damaged by flak. Failed to return from a mission
					to the Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau AG aircraft factory at Sorau, Prussia 11Apr44 (10INT). Intense and
					accurate flak was encountered in the vicinity of Hanover and struck the plane with both outboard engines
					damaged, leaking oil and fuel. The propellers were feathered and then the left inboard engine started
					losing power; the fuel transfer system had been damaged. The crew jettisoned everything they could to
					reduce weight and headed for what was thought to be Denmark. Coming in from the south they were
					spotted by a German Me 210 and started an attack. The crew fought back but the fighter was not
					damaged. In another attack, the fighter missed the bomber and fired directly towards a Swedish
					anti-aircraft artillery base. The Swedes shot back and struck the Me 210 with their first shot. The bomber
					circled around the burning plane then headed on eastwards. The Swedish flak battery fired warning shots,
					one of which struck the bomber, when passing over Sövde air base. The crew sent out emergency flares,
					the shooting stopped when they started to bailed out between Tågra and Lövestad. The pilot had lowered
					the bomber’s landing gear when being shot at by the Swedes and searched for a suitable field in
					which to land. Retracting the wheels, he missed a field of flowers and passed over a high voltage
					power line. The plane crash landed in a plowed field, swept through a stone wall and stopped in
					Tolånga, sixkm east of Vollsjö railway station, Sjöbo, Sweden. Having escaped the crash, the pilot
					returned to the plane, possibly with intent to destroyed secret equipment, but was prevented by a
					home guard who advised him that he was in Sweden; the pilot then relaxed. Salvaged and
					scrapped at Ystad, Sweden. {11 missions}.

					tire blew out. With the spare plane already taken, the crew waited for the wheel to be changed. Taking
					off late, the plane flew through a snowstorm and came out of the clouds facing their group going the
					other way. After rolling and diving out of the way, the plane joined the formation. Returning from the
					target, approaching the Belgian border, enemy fighters attacked. The No.3 engine had been hit and on
					fire as the pilot put the plane into a dive to try and extinguish the flames. By now there was fire in the
					radio room. As the crew started to bail out, the plane exploded and broke in two and crashed at Herfun,
					just south of Waldbrol, nineteen miles west of Siegen, Germany.

					Named "Hit Parade". Battle damaged on a mission to the Junkers aircraft factory at Halberstadt,
					Germany 11Jan44. The bomber took off with a load of 2,300 gallons of gasoline, 6,000 pounds of bombs,
					full load of ammunition, and the usual weight of men and equipment. It joined the squadron formation
					and flew to the target without incident but was forced to use 2,400 rpm and 40" at times. After dropping
					their bombs, the formation was attacked by fighters which stayed for one hour and 50 minutes. They
					attacked the squadron from 5-7 o'clock position at first and gradually as more enemy fighters
					joined they attacked from 3-9 o'clock positions. The crew was flying ‘Tail End Charlie’, #7 position.
					The fighters created excitement among the squadron, resulting in more power being applied to the engines.
					This crew was forced to use 2,500 rpm and 40-46" almost continuously. The plane was vibrating and
					pitching as a result of all guns firing, fighting propeller wash, and evading collision with their own
					as well as enemy planes. It seemed that the greater part of the attack was aimed at this bomber,
					perhaps because it was the only one in the group that was not firing tracer bullets and the enemy
					apparently thought it had no guns or were out of ammunition. Later the bomber was attacked by
					another group of enemy fighters numbering about 40. This time it was flying #3 position in the
					second element of the lead squadron. As the enemy fighters came in, The engineer/top turret
					gunner of this bomber shot down a Fw 190 which burst into flames, nosed up and to its left,
					thus colliding with the B-17 flying #2 position of the second element on the right. Immediately
					upon colliding this B-17 burst into flames, started into a loop but fell off on its left wing and
					across the tail of #957. Immediately upon being hit by the falling B-17 this aircraft nosed up and
					went into a loop. The action of the pilot was to engage the AFCE [automatic flight control equipment]
					which was set up for level flying. Full power was applied with throttle and both pilot and co-pilot
					began the struggle with the manual controls. It was noted at once that the rudder control was out
					because the rudder pedals could not be moved. In only a fraction of a second the bomber had
					completed a loop and was now spinning towards the ground, with five enemy fighters following
					on the tail. Although the spin seemed flat and rather slow it was vicious and the bomber was losing
					altitude fast. When the aircraft entered into the spin the pilot after determining its direction applied
					full inside throttle, retarded the other two, used only aileron AFCE control, and applied it in full
					opposite position, rolled elevator trim-tab fully forward, and in addition both pilots applied full
					forward position on control column, plus full opposite aileron. After making at least two or three
					complete 360-degree turns, the B-17 finally swept into a clean dive at an angle of approximately
					45 degrees from level. The IAS at this time was approximately 280 mph. The altitude was approximately
					12,000ft. At this point it was noted that one enemy fighter was still following the bomber, therefore
					seeing a solid undercast below the pilot nosed the bomber down and applied additional power.
					Finally leveled off in the clouds at 4,000ft, the pilot trimmed the aircraft, checked all engine instruments
					immediately after leveling off and found everything functioning normally, except the pilot's directional
					gyro which apparently had tumbled. Flew in the cloud cover for a while then rode the top of the clouds
					all the way back across the North Sea. The aircraft seemed to fly quite smoothly in spite of the missing
					vertical stabiliser and rudder. It was therefore decided by the pilot that a normal landing could be
					attempted. Reaching the English coast the pilot headed for the home airfield but the weather had
					closed in and the ceiling was getting lower. Finally, he was forced to fly at tree-top heights in order
					to stay out of the clouds, thus getting lost. All radio equipment was out and he was not sure where
					the field was. Finally it began to rain. The navigator volunteered to remain in the nose of the bomber
					to direct the pilot and co-pilot in their approach to the field and a final landing. The pilot made a
					perfect landing. After setting it on the ground it was noted that the right tire was flat. However, this
					did not trouble the pilot because the aircraft was stalled out at low speed and slowed down
					immediately by use of brakes. It was noted that the aircaft was almost dry of fuel. The gunners
					had shot down nine enemy aircraft and claimed to have damaged at least ten more.

					Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over
					the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal support but they obeyed the recall order to return to
					England and left the bombers to fend for themselves on the return trip. Luftwaffe attacks started over the
					IJsselmeer and intensified when the American fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak

					join formation above the overcast which consisted of anvil-headed cumulo-nimbus clouds.
					It entered the clouds at about 8,000ft and continued to climb on instruments. At 15,000ft the
					aircraft hit violent turbulent air, probably propeller wash from another B-17G, rolling the aircraft
					into an inverted dive. The aircraft disintegrated in the air as four crew members parachuted to
					safety. Crashed at Abbey Farm, Hoxne, near Horham airfield, Suffolk. Salvaged 24Apr44

					Named "Our Buddy". The crew of this plane wanted to name their plane in honor
					of the men who flew the fighter plane escorts who were able to accompany and provide
					protection for the bombers the entire route when additional fuel tanks were added to the
					fighters. The fighters were often referred to as “Little Friends” by the bomber crews, so this crew

					Walla Walla Field, WA 9Nov43. 730th Bomb Squadron [S], 452nd Bomb Group, Deopham
					Green (Station 142), Norfolk 4Jan44. Named "Inside Curve" The plane was named by the
					radio operator who was a big St. Louis Cardinals baseball fan. He knew that the inside curve
					pitch in baseball was the hardest to hit so the crew agreed to affix the name to their plane.
					Fitted with a revised Plexiglas nosepiece which was slightly shorter and a steeper forward
					up turn, primarily to prevent blast damage from chin turret when guns fired at maximum elevation.
					Damaged returning from slow timing an engine when the landing gear collapsed landing at Deopham Green 19Jul44.
					Crashed shortly after take off for a mission to aircraft factories at Bremen, Germany 12Oct44 (7KIA:2INJ).
					Having climbed through the fog, the plane was over the Wash, the crew checked their guns and oxygen
					at 13,000ft when the plane became unstable, possibly from propeller wash. The plane began to rock
					with one wing going up and another down then turned over onto its back as it began to spin towards the sea.
					Gravitational forces prevented any airmen from bailing out then the plane stopped spinning and dove straight
					down from about 15,000ft. With full power on the engines, the pilot was trying to pull the bomber
					out of the dive when the wings came off, it exploded and broke at the ball turret and tail door.
					The waist gunner was in the center section, now open at both ends. His parachute came sliding by,
					he clipped it on and pulled the ripcord which dragged him out and he was able to parachute to safety.
					The navigator was blown out of the nose when the plane exploded and also survived.
					The aircraft crashed two miles west of Ingham, Norfolk. Salvaged 18Oct44. {113 missions}

					Failed to return from a mission to the Heinkel Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory which had been converted
					to Fw 190 production at Warnemünde, Germany 9Apr44 (10POW). On return from the target the Group
					was attacked by enemy fighters before reaching the Danish coast. The bomber was hit in the No.2 engine
					and was losing fuel at an alarming rate. The navigator reported that if it continued losing fuel at this rate,
					it could only just reach Sweden. The pilot asked for a course and the aircraft calmly left formation and
					flew northwards. All ammunition and machine guns were thrown overboard, while it flew low over the sea.
					 At last the aircraft reached land. At that time none of the crew knew the colors of the Swedish flag, but from
					the flagstaffs they saw a red flag with a white cross. Denmark was occupied and therefore probably was not
					allowed to use their own flag, the crew agreed that this had to be Sweden. After ten or fifteen minutes of flying
					they saw an open field which was very suitable for landing. The pilot was circling around the field to check
					 it for ditches and fences, and when he was halfway across the field he suddenly discovered camouflaged
					 planes with the Swastika on the rudder. The pilot pulled the plane up and tried to turn away, but just then one
					of the gunners reported a Me 210 was on their tail and the light flak became awake and fired warning shots.
					Without machine guns and ammunition the crew did not have a chance and the pilot returned to the runway.
					From this day and after thirteen months in a German POW camp, the pilot stated that there were ten Americans
					that learned to know the difference between the Danish and the Swedish flag.
					Condemned by Air Forces Materiel Service Command 9Apr44. MACR 3785
					The aircraft was repaired and operated by Luftwaffe KG 200, possibly coded A3+BB. Reported that the
					airplane was lost to German flak 6Apr45. The airplane was attempting to evade advancing Allied armies,
					and there was no method of alerting the German anti-aircraft batteries that the B-17 was a captured aircraft
					rather than an enemy invader. The airplane caught fire and was destroyed

					Battle damaged on a mission to a railway bridge crossingthe Iscaro River at Bolzano, South Tyrol,
					Italy 13May44 (1WIA:9RTD). Flak at the target was heavy. The plane received damage and the
					pilot was injured. Accident during a mission to a railway marshalling yard at Saint-Étienne,
					France 26May44 (1KIA:1POW:2EVD:6RTD). The bomber was approximately sixty to seventy miles
					inland north of Nice, France, on course to the target when an instantaneous explosion set the
					cabin on fire. The pilot turned away from the formation immediately. The heat was so intense
					that it appeared the crew must leave the plane. The co-pilot, bombardier, navigator, and upper
					turret gunner, all in the forward part of the plane, bailed out over mountains on the French/Italian border.
					The pilot then picked up a reciprocal heading for Corsica. The plane was filled with smoke and flying debris.
					The fire was apparently caused by an explosion of oxygen, oil and electrical sparks. The crew had
					emptied two Co2 fire extinguishers on the fire before they bailed out, but that did no apparent good.
					The fire was spreading, the pilot switched on the automatic pilot, then threw out burning flak
					suits and cushions. The ammunition cartridge belts were exploding and throwing tracers, incendiaries,
					and powder all over the cockpit and cabin. The smoke was so thick at times that he could not see
					the instrument panel, and had all four cockpit windows open as well as holding his oxygen hose
					out the window so that he could breathe. Up to this time, it had been impossible to establish
					contact with the gunners in the waist, since the interphone was burnt out. When 125 miles from
					Corsica, the pilot attempted to establish contact by VHF radio. The radio operator had his jackbox
					switched to command, and he told the pilot that there were crew members in the back; up
					to that time, he thought that he was alone. The radio operator then set up an interphone system
					through the liaison transmitter and receiver, and the pilot was able to contact the airmen in the
					waist. The radio operator then came forward and extinguished part of the blaze on the walls
					of the cabin and floor with his canteen of water and another bottle of Co2. The cockpit windows
					were completely covered with cordite smoke from exploding cartridges and the pilot could not
					see unless he stuck his head out the window into the slipstream. The two waist gunners, ball
					turret gunner, and tail gunner wanted to bail out. The radio operator went forward again
					and found that the fire was dying down, so went back to the rear of his compartment and
					advised the gunners to stay put. By this time, the radio operator was in the cockpit and
					helping maintain a steady contact with the radar station on Corsica. When approximately
					ten minutes from Corsica, the fire, which had burned for forty-five to fifty minutes, was
					finally extinguished. When the fire started, the plane was at 21,000ft, and the oxygen system
					failed. The pilot dove the plane to 17,000ft and maintained that altitude until leaving the
					coast of France, at which time he descended to 12,000ft as rapidly as possible since he
					was nearly unconscious from lack of oxygen. The bomb load was jettisoned and the plane
					reached Corsica where the pilot made an approach for landing. Because he could not see
					very well through the windscreens, he overshot the landing, and when he did land the hydraulic
					system failed in a shower of hydraulic fluid when the brakes were applied. This small
					civilian airport at Ajaccio couldn’t accommodate larger planes so the bomber rolled past
					the runway and out into an open field. Directly ahead of it, a farmer was plowing with a
					team of horses. The pilot cut No.1, 2, and 3 engines while operating No.4 to the maximum.
					He plowed furrows three feet deep when the plane spun around in a perfectly controlled ground
					loop; it missed the farmer. Repaired and returned to Group. 49th Bomb Squadron Jun44.
					Battle damaged on a mission to the aircraft engine factories at Wiener Neudorf,
					Austria 26Jul44 (1WIA:9RTD). Flak was heavy, moderate and accurate resulting in injury
					to the ball turret gunner. Battle damaged on a mission to the south railway bridge in
					Budapest, Hungary 5Sep44 (1WIA:9RTD). Flak was intense and accurate causing serious
					injury to the radio operator. On return, the plane landed at Foggia Main where he was
				 	immediately taken to a hospital. Failed to return from a mission to the Sudetenländische
					Treibstoffwerke AG synthetic oil refinery at Záluží, Brüx, Sudetenland 20Oct44 (10RTD).
					Number one engine was hit by flak over the target; it kept running, but could not maintain
					power. The pilot descended to 15,000ft and headed for Italy. Later, number four engine
					lost power, then number one failed completely. Now down to only two engines, the airplane
					continued to lose altitude, and when it reached 6,000ft, the number three engine stopped
					from fuel starvation. By that time the crew was over the Adriatic and thirty miles from the
					closest landing ground. The pilot decided to ditch while he still had some power left. At 400 feet,
					the last engine stopped, and the pilot made a power off descent to a safe splashdown in the
					Adriatic Sea off Ravenna, Italy. The crew climbed into the dinghies and a short time later
					RAF Spitfires were circling over them. In about thirty minutes, a PBY Catalina landed, picked
					them up, and took them to the Foggia Station Hospital for observation .MACR 5831.

					Major Ware and his crew made a fat-cat flight to Sydney, Australia in 42-40491), ‘Poochie’,
					borrowed from the 528th Bomb Squadron. The night spent in Sydney proved a little too
					much for the crew on the return trip July 29, 1942, and somewhere over the
					Northern Territory they discovered that ‘Poochie’ was lost and running
					of gas. Unable to locate a landing strip, Major Ware finally set the
					plane down in a crash landing on a large grassy flat (near Black Sand Plain)
					which ultimately turned out to be somewhere near the mouth of the Daly River.
					The plane was not badly damaged and a few sprains were the only casualties.
					They found themselves in the unpleasant predicament, however, of being
					completely without water and isolated in an unknown part of the bush country.
					The former problem was fairly easily solved, for the plane was carrying
					a load of whiskey and beer back to Fenton and the bottles had not been
					broken in landing. Soon nearly everyone in the party had quenched his
					thirst by consuming ample quantities of the alcoholic beverages, with
					the usual results. Three search planes had been dispatched, and Captain
					Gus Connery soon picked up distress signals being sent out on the
					Gibson Girl radio by M/Sgt. James Griffin, communications chief, one
					of the unlucky passengers on ‘Poochie’. As the search plane reached
					the vicinity of the lost party, the men on the ground set off flares to
					mark their position. This maneuver had poor results, for the grass
					caught fire downwind of the plane and the blaze spread quickly,
					devouring ‘Poochie’ and all the equipment aboard

					44092 (MSN 88-13705) 318th Flying Training Detachment (Primary), Avenger Field,
						Sweetwater, TX; operated by Aviation Enterprises. Crashed ten miles northwest of
						Quartzite, AZ 25Feb44 (1KIS). The WASP trainee pilot was on the return leg of a solo
						cross-country training flight to Tucson and had just left Blythe Field, CA. The pilot was
						seen by a witness on the ground to bail out of a smoking aircraft. Taking two other men
						to help him, the witness, a miner, located the pilot about 45 minutes later. The pilot had
						been dragged by her parachute over rocky ground in the strong wind and was seriously i
						njured. She was taken by truck to Quartzite and was transferred to an Army ambulance and
						taken to the Base Hospital at Blythe Army Air Field. She died from her injuries shortly after
						admission to the hospital. Examination of the crash site found the wreckage in two main areas.
						Part of the tail section, including the right horizontal stabilizer, was found in a burned
						condition at the top of a mountain. The rest of the plane was found at the foot of the mountain
						with no signs of burning. The report concludes that the WASP abandoned the plane after
						sparks from the engine exhaust set fire to the fabric covered horizontal stabilizer and she
						lost control of the plane. Surveyed at Matagorda Peninsula Field, TX 24Mar44.

				46574 (MSN 1308) War Bond aircraft, "The Fighting Falcon". In early 1943 the public school children of
					Greenville, Michigan where the glider manufacturer was based, decided that they wanted to help
					with the war effort. They agreed to sell War Bonds and Stamps so they could purchase one of the
					Gibson gliders and donate it to the Air Force. During their month long sales campaign in April 1943
					they sold $72,000 in war bonds and stamps, enough to buy not one, but four Gibson gliders.
					However, only one would be named. The children decided to name the glider ‘The Flying Falcon’.
					An officer of the Gibson Refrigerator Company had decided the name Flying Falcon was not fierce
					enough and he had changed it to ‘The Fighting Falcon’. For their contribution to the war effort
					the children were awarded the US Treasury Department’s Distinguished Service Award, the first
					time this award had ever been given to a group of children. The Falcon was towed to Black Field,
					the Greenville High School football field where it was christened and turned over to the
					US Army Air Force on May 19, 1943, following a much publicized dedication ceremony attended
					by high-level government and local officials. It was subsequently disassembled, packed in
					five huge wooden crates, and loaded on two railroad flat cars. Approximately 2 June, two weeks
					after its dedication, it left Greenville headed for Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania,
					where it was stored until it was moved by rail to a mid-Atlantic port for transit by ship to England.
					In April 1944 it was uncrated and assembled by work crews of the 26th Mobile Reclamation
					and Repair Squadron (Heavy) at Crookham Common (Station429), Berkshire. After learning of
					The Fighting Falcon and its unique history, General Paul Williams decreed that it would be
					the lead glider in the D-Day invasion of Normandy in recognition of the Greenville school
					children’s patriotic spirit. On 3 June 1944, three days before D-Day, Colonel Murphy decided
					to replace the original Falcon with a CG-4A equipped with the frontal crash protection device,
					the Griswold Nose. After all of the publicity photographs were taken the original Gibson-built
					Falcon was shunted back to position No. 45 in the 52 glider “Chicago” serial. Murphy then
					ordered a hasty paint job on the replacement glider to make it look like the original Falcon.
					434th Troop Carrier Group, Ninth Air Force, Aldermaston (Station 467). The glider was
					transporting men and materials for the 101st Airborne Division to a landing zone at Hiesville,

					The Stinson had just landed and cleared to taxy to the hangar complex. Cessna R172E, N96218, was
					cleared to taxy from another hangar complex to the active runway for an IFR departure. The pilot of
					the Cessna reported that he had started his taxy from the hangar and was approaching the taxyway.
					He saw another aircraft moving in his direction in an apparent straight line. The Cessna pilot did
					not hear or receive any transmissions regarding other aircraft on the taxyway since he had been
					cleared to taxy. He flashed his lights at the oncoming aircraft to gain the other pilot's attention.
					A witness to the accident reported that the pilot of the Stinson did not appear to be doing S-turns
					while taxying to the ramp. The pilot of the Stinson stated that he saw the Cessna one to two seconds
					before impact. The Stinson pilot reported that he did hear the ground controller in contact with
					another aircraft, but that there were three different ways to get to the active runway from those
					hangars. Both aircraft were operating on clearances from the North Las Vegas Air Traffic Control
					Tower ground controller.

					as N69775; cancelled 2May13. Damaged in a forced landing two miles north of Arlington Municipal
					Airport, WA 14Jul96. The plane took off and climbed to 1,200 feet. When the engine started to lose
					power, the pilot checked fuel pressure, turning on the electric boost pump and the fuel pressure
					remained the same; however, the engine lost power all the way to idle. The pilot had to make an
					emergency landing in a corn field, about two miles north of Arlington Municipal Airport. The plane
					hit the ground very hard and rebounded into the air. It turned a little to the right, hit the ground,
					rolled forward, tipped up on the nose and the left wing tip hit the high ground. The main landing
					gear had collapsed, and the right steps broken off and lying under right main gear. Left steps were
					bent backwards. Tail wheel was damaged when it impacted the ground. Left wing tip was damaged
					outboard the spar. Engine lower cowling was bent at the time of impact. Also at impact, the
					propeller spinner was pushed in around the propeller hub and both propeller blades were bent.
					Removed the propeller spinner, propeller and valve cover and were found that the engine was out of
					time. Removed starter and found the cotter key missing from the castellated nut, which had backed
					off of the timing gear and starter jaw assembly. The backing off of the castellated nut would allow
					the timing gear to retard engine timing until there was no power being produced. The cotter key was
					found in the magnetic oil plug. The propeller was not turning when it hit the ground, because the
					scratches were parallel with the propeller leading edge. Registered 18Feb16 as N69775; cancelled

				47379 (MSN 7321) to USAAF Jul 2, 1942. 60th Troop Carrier Squadron, 63rd Troop Carrier Group,
					Victorville Army Flying School, CA. On 16 December 1942, the aircraft took off from South Plains Army Air Field
					towing a Waco CG-4A glider being ferried to Victorville Army Flying School at Victorville, California.
					The flight plan included an overnight stop at Tucson, Arizona. In addition to the flight crew the aircraft
					carried four passengers. It was almost dark when the tow plane/glider combination arrived over
					Blythe Army Air Field, California, 150 miles south of Victorville. Suddenly, the glider pilot saw a light blinking
					in the astrodome of the C-53, the normal night signal for the pilot to release the glider. Believing they were over
					Tucson, their planned overnight stop, the pilot released his glider and landed. Once on the ground he began
					staking down the glider and adding chocks to the ailerons, elevators and rudder. Just as he completed
					preparing the glider for an overnight stay the tower notified him that the C-53 pilot had radioed that the glider
					had landed at the wrong base. The tower operator added that the C-53 was landing to retrieve the glider.
					The C-53 copilot had erroneously given the cutoff signal. After the tow plane landed it took some time for
					base personnel to locate the tow rope in the fading light. The glider pilot tried to convince the tow pilot to
					remain overnight but he refused. Eye-witnesses indicated that the tow pilot appeared to be anxious to get
					underway. He taxyed the C-53 to a point adjacent to the east end of the east-west runway and stopped.
					The glider copilot took a flashlight and motioned the tow plane into position on the runway. Then the glider
					was towed into position behind the tow plane. When the glider was in position the tow rope was hooked
					to the C-53 while the glider pilot hooked it to the CG-4A, one of many mistakes; the tow rope was not to be
					hooked to the glider until both pilots were in their seats with their safety belts fastened. The glider pilot
					instructed an aircraft mechanic from the base to get the flashlight and stand by the left wingtip of the
					tow plane so he could signal the tow pilot to take up the slack in the tow rope. Just before entering the glider
					the pilot noticed that the chocks had not been removed from the ailerons, elevators and rudder. He instructed
					his copilot to remove the chocks from the right aileron while he removed them from the elevators and rudder.
					He started for the left aileron when suddenly the glider began moving forward. The tow pilot had interpreted
					the half-moon signal given to take up the tow rope slack as the signal to take off. As the glider moved forward
					the glider pilot ran for the door of the glider but never made it; the glider was moving too fast. Before he and
					his copilot could get out of the way, the rear elevator struck them and knocked them down. The tow plane
					took off and made a 270 degree turn to the right, flew south a short distance, turned left and then made a
					360 degree turn to the right. At this point the tow plane was over the south edge of the field at approximately
					400 feet when the pilot released the glider. The aircraft accident report indicated that the pilotless glider
					collided with the tow plane damaging the left horizontal stabilizer causing the pilot to lose control of the
					aircraft. The C-53 stalled and crashed almost immediately followed by the glider a short distance away [8KIS].

						Flying Training Group, Luke Field, Glendale, AZ. Crashed on Towers Mountain, the highest peak
						in the Bradshaw Mountains near Crown King, AZ 25Mar44. Three AT-6C aircraft departed from
						Luke Field for a 3½ hour proficiency flight; it is not known if they planned to fly in formation
						or individually. The weather that afternoon consisted of moderate turbulence and scattered
						cumulus clouds with a cold front forming. Further north of Phoenix, the wind started to pick
						up and there were reported gusts of up to 30 mph. The three aircraft had not returned to
						Luke Field by that evening and without any word from the three aircraft they were officially
						reported as missing. Base officials had no idea where to start their search since all three of
						the pilots had not indicated to the Flying Operations Officer where they planned on flying.
						The search for the aircraft was called off 1Apr44. On 28 July 1944, just over four months after
						they crashed, a Luke Field aircraft flying near Crown King in the Bradshaw Mountains spotted
						silver aluminum among pine trees that appeared to be a plane. The following day, crash
						investigators made their way down the steep canyon and found that the plane had crash landed.
						Although the plane had been damaged upon impact, it was in surprisingly good condition
						with the wings and fuselage relatively intact. The plane’s identity was confirmed by the serial
						number as that of 42-49009. The two other AT-6’s had crashed a quarter mile further up the canyon.
						These two planes had hit much harder and the twisted, burned remnants were all that remained.
						It appeared that the formation had tried to fly up the canyon just above tree-top level and, not
						realizing there was a strong downdraft until it was too late, simply didn’t have enough horsepower
						 to climb out. Small amounts of wreckage, including part of a tail section, that were scattered down
						a slope above the crashes indicates where they had tried to turn around, but instead clipped the
						 trees on a ridge before plunging into the canyon below.
