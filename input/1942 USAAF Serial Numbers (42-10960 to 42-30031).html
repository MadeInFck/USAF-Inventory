					Without the records for the aircraft's maintenance history, and as the Harvard could

					Registered as N766CA as a SNJ-5C; current [Jun19]. Crashed when it collided with trees
					and terrain while maneuvering in the vicinity of Pilot's Pasture airstrip, near Winlock,
					Washington 13Aug98 and destroyed in a post-crash fire. The flight had originated at
					Vancouver, Washington, where the airplane had been refueled, and the destination was the
					Pilot's Pasture airstrip. Witnesses observed the airplane make a low pass to the east along
					the east-west runway of the airstrip, followed by an 8-point roll, a 90-270 degree course
					reversal, and another low pass to the west with a pull-up into either a loop or Cuban-eight
					maneuver. Just after attaining the top of this last maneuver, the airplane was rolled out
					with a heading change toward the south and a loss of altitude, where it was observed to
					be near level attitude before the left wing dropped and it disappeared from view due to
					obscuration by trees. Impact was heard shortly after the airplane disappeared from
					view (2 fatalities).

				First flight at Fort Worth, TX 8Aug46. Damaged by mechanical failure six miles east of Fort Worth 30Sep46.
				After takeoff from Fort Worth 26Mar47, as the hydraulic system attempted to raise the right landing gear,
				the actuator exploded allowing the gear to swing in the slip stream. While burning off fuel,
				crew members bailed out, leaving the two pilots to attempt a landing back at Fort Worth.
				Without hydraulics, the flaps could not be extended and the brakes and nose wheel steering were
				inoperative. On landing, the right landing gear held in place and the aircraft drifted off the
				left side of the runway. Delivered to USAF Jun48. Participated in a series of tests with
				Caterpillar tracked landing gear. Taxy tests carried out at Fort Worth early March 1950.

42-13584/13601		Douglas A-33
				Northrop/Douglas Model 8A-5, MSN 715/750 bought by Norway as an attack bomber for the Royal Norwegian
					Army Air Service. After the German occupation of Norway they were diverted to the Norwegian
					flying training centre known as 'Little Norway' at Toronto Island, Canada. Norwegian serials were
					D-1/D-36, later 301/371 [odd numbers only]. They were considered unsuited for training, Peru offering
					to purchase the 18 survivors. The State Department objected because of fears that they might be used
					against Ecuador. It was proposed that these planes be delivered instead to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease,
					but both Peru and Norway objected. Consequently, the USAAF took over owership of these planes Dec 9, 1941.
					under the designation of A-33 and assigned the serials 42-13584/13601.

						Hammer Crop Dusters Inc., Sacramento, CA. Operated for Canadian Forest Protection Limited spruce
						budworm spray program New Brunswick 1955; sprayer code 52. Crashed and destroyed during aerial
						application when the pilot failed to maintain flying speed and stalled into the ground near Nictau
						airstrip, New Brunswick 9Jun55. The pilot turned downwind throwing the aircraft out of control and
						into heavy bushes on a nearby island in the river. The pilot had come in nose high and with wings
						level between two trees, shearing the trunks close to the tops and removing all four wing panels.
						The Stearman hit the ground flat on the fuselage but spun around, driving a two-inch branch through
						the fuselage behind the cockpit, narrowly missing the pilot. A large raft was constructed to obtain
						access to the area. Over the next several days, people, equipment and pieces of airplane were
						shuttled to and from the island. To get the airplane out of the trees, the fuselage was cut just behind
						the cockpit into two sections. The rudder, elevators, horizontal stabilizer and other small parts were
						transported back to the strip by raft. The engine was to be taken back by a Royal Canadian Navy HUP-3
						helicopter, as was the fuselage from the firewall back to the cockpit. On the day of the lift the wind
						had picked up. The lift of the cockpit and hopper section went alright, but the engine posed a problem.
						While the helicopter was approaching the airstrip, the load went wide, pulling the helicopter out with
						it after which the pilot let go, smashing the engine into the ground from 150 feet. Operated for
						Canadian spruce budworm spray program 1958; sprayer code 356. Registration cancelled 23Sep70

				15890 (MSN 7407) to USAAF Aug 16, 1942. To Chinese National Aviation Corp (CNAC) Sep 18, 1942 under Lend-Lease
					as CNAC 58. Crashed near Naga Hills, China while flying the Hump Apr 7, 1943.
					The aircraft was en route from Dinjan, India to Kunming, China 7Apr43; it was a routine cargo flight over the Hump on Able
					route loaded with graphite electrodes destined for an electric smelting furnace in China. As the aircraft climbed high to
					cross the mountains on the India-Burma border, it started accumulating a heavy load of ice and losing altitude.
					The pilot called Dinjan and said he couldn't make it over the border mountains and he needed to return to Dinjan.
					He turned the the aircraft 180 degrees and proceeded to return to his home base. With the palm of his hand held
					against the windshield to melt the ice and his face pressed against the glass in an effort to see, the aircraft had
					no sooner turned when it skimmed across the snow-covered ridge of a mountain. The mountain tore off the engines
					and landing gear, and the aircraft slid to a stop at almost 15,000 ft altitude on a steep slope just below the summit
					of the mountain. The radio operator was killed in the crash; the pilot and co-pilot were slightly injured.
					After weeks of agonizing travel down the mountain, the pilot and co-pilot eventually reached a tiny tribal village.
					The Mishmi villagers cared for the pilot and co-pilot until a runner could bring a British survey team to the village,
					and then the Mishmis helped carry the crew down to the US base at Sadiya, Assam, India.

						Operated for Canadian spruce budworm spray program 1958; sprayer code 54. Crashed and destroyed
						during aerial application in a forced landing after takeoff from a private airstrip operated by
						Northcana at Little Rapids, Ontario 25Apr61. During the initial climb, the pilot's vision became
						obscured by venting fuel and the aircraft crashed shortly after. The fuel sight gauge located on
						the underside of the upper wing centre section fractured, allowing fuel to escape into the airstream.
						Though the pilot was wearing protective goggles, he found his vision badly obscured. He considered
						that the fuel supply would quickly become exhausted and attempted a shallow left turn to return
						to the airstrip. The aircraft stalled during the turn and the left wing dropped. Recovery was made
						but the aircraft touched down on soft ground and the undercarriage came in contact with a fallen
						tree trunk, which caused the aircraft to overturn. Registration cancelled 22Aug62.

						Golden Wings Advertising Inc, Albuquerque, NM. The airplane was substantially damaged during landing at
						Taos, New Mexico 11May96. When the pilot turned on final approach, the wind caused the airplane to
						drift slightly right of the runway centerline. He corrected and made a normal wheel landing. As speed
						dissipated and the tail wheel settled to the ground, the airplane shuddered slightly. It suddenly veered
						to the right and the right wing rose. Full right aileron and left rudder were applied but to no avail. The left
						brake was applied and locked but the airplane continued to veer right. The left wing contacted the
						runway and the airplane went off the right side of the runway into soft dirt, shearing off the left main
						 landing gear. A dust devil had been seen on the south side of the airport just before the accident occurred.
						The airplane was substantially damaged during landing at Cottonwood Airport (P52) Cottonwood, AZ 17May09.
						The pilot and passenger were conducting a cross country flight from San Diego, CA to Albuquerque, NM.
						The flight included a fuel stop at Blythe, CA prior to proceeding to an additional fuel stop in Cottonwood, AZ.
						During the landing at Cottonwood airport the pilot reported that there was a gust of wind that tilted the
						aircraft to the left resulting in a clipping of the left wing on the runway. It resulted in the aircraft veering
						off the runway to the left, coming to rest in soft soil and causing major structural damage to the bottom
						left wing, including the spar and several ribs. Registration current [Dec20].

					73rd Ferrying Squadron, 21st Ferrying Group, Palm Springs Field, CA.
					Crashed three miles southeast on approach to Palm Springs Field 3Dec43 [1KIS].
					A WASP pilot, assigned to the 5th Ferrying Group, Love Field, Dallas was sent to Palm Springs Field
					for pursuit plane training for the P-39, P-40, and P-47. Initial training started from the rear seat of an
					AT-6 or BC-1, (37-652) which simulated the view from a pursuit plane cockpit. The WASP pilot took off from
					Palm Springs for a routine training flight in the front seat with her instructor in the rear seat.
					They made several landings and were on final approach in a normal gliding attitude for another,
					when another aircraft of the same unit turned onto final approach from a shorter base leg;
					it was Bell P-39Q Airacobra 42-19531. Ground witnesses reported that the BC-1 pilots, seeing the P-39,
					apparently attempted to abort the landing and pulled up into the path of the P-39, which was apparently
					aborting its landing as well. The P-39 severed the tail section of the BC-1 and both aircraft crashed to the
					ground near the airfield a short distance from each other, with the BC-1 bursting into flames upon impact.
					Pilot killed, as were the two people onboard the BC-1..
					According to one source, there were several trainers and pursuits in the air.
					The BC-1 had just been cleared to make a final landing. The tower had also cleared the P-39 to come in second.
					Investigators believed that this accident was caused by the inability of the pilot of the P-39, when turning
					on to the final approach, to see the BC-1, which was already on final approach, because of the position
					of the sun and the banking attitude of the P-39. It was also believed that the operation of camouflaged
					aircraft in this area was a contributing factor to the accident

					was burning. I pushed the throttle forward to blow it out and instead of doing this it flamed
					up higher, so we cut the engine by pulling the throttle and mixture controls back and turned
					off the switches and fuel. Then I got off the wing and took a fire extinguisher and tried
					to put it out." The airplane had vented fuel on the fire and was destroyed.

					On March 5, 1944 the fighter took off on a combat patrol with other aircraft to search for Japanese aircraft.
					Proceeding towards the Tadji area, they spotted enemy aircraft over Wewak, and intercepted three
					Ki-48's of the 208th Sentai approaching Dagua. The pilot was attacked by a Ki-43 Oscar from the 77th Sentai
					and crashed. He was observed by local people on the ground to have bailed out and as he decended he became
					tangled in a tree and died of bullet wounds from the attack. MACR 6579 and 7540.
					During 2001, the tail section and one of the machine guns from the wreckage were recovered by Robert Greinert
					who transported them to Sydney and stored them at HARS. During 2003, both items were donated to the

					On April 29, 1944 the aircraft took off from Nadzab #3 Airfield (Fighter Strip) to test fly this
					P-47 and test fire the guns over Faita. No contact was made after take-off. When the pilot failed to
					return he was officially declared Missing In Action (MIA). MACR 5808. In fact, the aircraft crashed largely
					intact in the Finisterre Mountains. The pilot attempted to crash land with the plane and probably died near
					the crash site or in the vicinity from injuries. The fighter hit a tree on approach, sheared off the tail and
					pancaked to earth. The pilot couldn't open the canopy because it was jammed by the left wing which broke off
					and flipped over the fuselage. During 1979, this P-47 was first located at roughly 8,200' elevation near
					the Nando village and Tauta by a group of student trekkers as part of "Operation Drake".
					When they discovered the P-47, the cockpit canopy was in the closed position, and no human remains were
					seen at the crash site. During 1990, a US Army Central Identification Laboratory Hawaii (CILHI) team surveyed.
					Later, during 1999, two other teams also surveyed the site. None of them found any remains or personal effects.
					But this wreck site was never the subject of a dedicated search, and this wreck is listed as an open MIA case.
					In early October 2004, Alfred Hagen / Aero Archaeology funded the salvage of this aircraft by Robert Greinert
					using a helicopter. During the salvage the wreck was not able to be lifted so the engine was cut off.
					Afterwards, the wreckage was containered at Lae and exported to Sydney. Since 2004, this wreck has been
					stored at Historic Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) at Albion Park Airfield, Illawarra, NSW, Australia
					and is under restoration. Will eventually be donated to a museum.

					Shot down by small arms fire attacking German guns dug in on a hill near Lutzkampen, Germany
					September 21, 1944. The Germans used their machine guns to fire a wall of lead into the air,
					hitting a fuel line on the left side of the cockpit. With fuel flooding the floor of the cockpit,
					the pilot climbed for altitude and jettisoned the canopy. The fuel ignited, the pilot leaned out
					the left side to escape the flames, the blast tearing off his helmet, then released his harness
					and bailed out of the right side. The pilot was jackknifed by the wind blast and his lower legs
					were pinned inside the cockpit, being badly burnt by the flames. He came free and parachuted to
					the ground, arrested by German soldiers, taken to hospital and became a POW. The aircraft crashed at Brodenbach, Germany.

					Accident 28Nov43 landing at Love Field; The WASP pilot was being checked out to fly pursuit
					airplanes. Prior to her formal training, she was sent off to carry out some practice landings in a
					P-47 at Love Field. With strong winds, only the short runway was being used, barely long enough
					for a P-47 to clear obstacles, land and stop by the end of it. It was late in the day and the weather
					was not good. The WASP's last landing was in a heavy haze, into the setting sun, and she knew
					to maintain altitude to clear a drive-in theater and a high voltage power line. With the limited
					visibility of a large radial engine ahead, the pilot approached too low and struck the power line.
					 It disrupted the airfield lighting and communications. The plane began to roll, the nose
					went up and it was difficult to control as it ran along the runway. The plane veered off
					the runway towards parked planes and a hangar so the pilot decided to go around. The plane
					barely cleared the hangar and, with full throttle, flew just above stalling speed. The pilot considered
					bailing out and flew out towards Lake Dallas but managed to gain some altitude and attempted
					some simulated landings. Gaining confidence, the pilot returned to Love Field, did a flyby
					to confirm that the landing gear was down and set up for a landing. Vehicles had been lined
					up on a longer runway to guide the pilot who made one go around before finally landing,
					taking care to avoid a ground looped into airplanes parked along each side of the runway.
					The power line had ripped open the lower fuselage from the engine to the tail. Part of the rudder
					was missing, one wing flap was torn off and one foot of one propeller blade was missing

					Over the target, the American formation was intercepted by six Ki-68 Tonys from the 68th Sentai
					and four Ki-43 Oscars of the 77th Sentai. The Japanese fighters claimed twelve P-47s shot down,
					five P-47s probables and a B-25 uncertain (in reality, three P-47's did not return from the mission).

					Disassembled and shipped overseas to Australia and reassembled. On February 25, 1944, a P-40 Kittyhawk
					#42-105306 landed on Gordon Strip at Iron Range, QLD, Australia and pulled up off the main runway on
					the right shoulder. Almost at once a P-47D Thunderbolt #42-22973 landed but did not touch down on
					the bitumen part of the runway; it was well over to the right with one wheel on the shoulder of the strip.
					The P-47 continued on parallel with the strip in long low bounces. At the end of the fourth bounce
					the P-47 collided with the P-40 Kittyhawk. The main plane of the P-47 slid up the fuselage of the P-40
					and struck the pilot on the back of the head severing his head and killing him instantly, also
					tearing away part of the wing of his aircraft. The P-47 proceeded on some distance before overturning.
					The pilot of the P-47 was extricated from beneath his aircraft unharmed but his aircraft was badly damaged.
					The pilot was returning to New Guinea from 2 weeks leave in Australia. The P-47 Thunderbolt was
					condemned on March 2, 1944. The aircraft wreckage was later sold to a fisherman who removed the
					aluminium from the wreckage which was later sold to Keith Hopper who placed the P-47 fuselage into storage.
					He plans to restore the P-47 Thunderbolt after he has finished restoring his P-40 Kittyhawk to flying status.

					On May 18, 1944 the aircraft took off from Saidor Airfield leading a strafing mission against
					Wewak. Over the target, it was hit by anti-aircraft fire which set the aircraft on fire.
					Climbing upwards, the pilot bailed out at only 250ft and his parachute only made one swing
					before he hit the ground. Fellow pilots in his squadron saw him land successfully and take
					cover in the jungle. They noted his position near Sani village, about 12 miles from the mouth
					of the Ramu River. The next day, a Stinson L-5 piloted by a member of the 69th FS located
					the pilot who had used his parachute to indicate his position at the edge of a clearing.
					The L-5 dropped an M-1 carbine, ammunition, machete, food, medical supplies, blankets and
					letters from his girlfriend at home. Eleven days later, a L-5 landed in a kunai grass covered
					clearing, but was unable to take off. Together, the two pilots worked for two days to clear a
					runway in the grass. On May 31, the L-5 attempted to take off twice but was unable to get
					airborne until the third try when it returned to base.

					have a fuselage". The propeller from this aircraft was salvaged, and is displayed at
					Weipa Airfield, Queensland. The tail section was moved by the Australian Army to the Weipa Bus Depot in 1991.

					Crashed at Djerba, Tunisia 22Aug43 [1KIA]. Some aircraft in the Squadron were sent to a high
					cliff-side bluff landing strip at Ra's al Jurf facing the offshore resort island of Djerba, for
					glider tow practice. The landing strip was on a high bluff immediately adjacent to the Mediterranean
					it had very helpful updrafts. Six of the 53rd's aircraft took off in formation to return to their home base.
					This aircraft took off in formation with the others, but left the formation soon after take-off.
					The plane circled and came in for a landing and seemed to get down safely when at the last minute the
					nose went down and it crashed steeply into the ground, smashing the landing gear, exploding the right fuel
					tank, and half-rolled, half-skidded to a stop with fire burning fiercely in the right nacelle. There were ten
					glider pilot passengers and the usual crew of four. All of the passengers got out the main door as soon
					as it could be forced open. Nothing could be done to save the burning plane and everyone withdrew to a
					safe distance. The remaining fuel tanks exploded a few seconds later and the fore part of the plane was
					completely destroyed in the fire. The cause of the crash was the failure of the pilot, copilot and crew
					chief to remove the aft right elevator control surface lock prior to takeoff, and subsequent incorrect trim
					tab adjustment by the pilot.

					262nd Base Unit, Bruning Field, NB. Crashed three miles west of Naper, NB 3Aug44. The crash at Naper, Nebraska,

					United States. A flight crew of four (4) in the C-47A were transporting twenty-four (24) rated P-47 pilots from the
					Bruning Army Air Field to the Pierre Army Air Field, South Dakota, for advanced training. Near the small town of
					Naper the plane encountered a thunderstorm and apparently flew into it or tried to get above it. Witnesses on the
					ground said that a simultaneous flash of lightning coincided with them hearing the motors of the plane stop.
					The plane was then seen coming down out of the clouds and out of control. The plane crashed in a ravine in a
					pasture instantly killing all 28 aboard. Investigation into the accident determined that wreckage had been scattered
					across an area two hundred yards wide by one mile long leading up to the actual site of the impact.
					The exact cause of the crash was never fully determined and several possibilities existed as to why the C-47 crashed.

					Crashed after a mid-air collision with 42-24030 at Witcha, Ramsbury 30Nov43 [4KIS]. Three C-47s were flying at
					low altitude in a 'vee' formation when two of the planes touched wings in mid-air and spun out of control
					crashing either side of a narrow country road near Witcha Farm, 1.5 miles south-west of Membury (Station 466).
					They had been up for about 45 minutes in the local area on a routine formation training mission.
					The group had returned to Welford and each made a follow through landing, taking off again at a safe
					interval one behind each other. The three aircraft then flew almost directly westward for 6 miles towards
					Membury, still in line astern. As they reached the southern edge of the airfield the wingmen began to
					formate on their leader and it was at this point that the collision occurred. The aircraft had been
					flying low, about 150 feet, and the pilot of the lead aircraft [42-24030] pulled up to gain altitude
					and started to turn to the left. This plane was on the inside of the turn and slid into the leader.
					The two aircraft collided at an altitude of about 400 feet above the terrain. Condemned 2Dec43.

					Crashed after a mid-air collision with 42-24028 at Witcha, Ramsbury 30Nov43 [5KIS]. Three C-47s were flying at low altitude
					in a 'vee' formation when two of the planes touched wings in mid-air and spun out of control crashing either
					side of a narrow country road near Witcha Farm, 1.5 miles south-west of Membury (Station 466). They had
					been up for about 45 minutes in the local area on a routine formation training mission. The group had
					returned to Welford and each made a follow through landing, taking off again at a safe interval one behind
					each other. The three aircraft then flew almost directly westward for 6 miles towards Membury, still in
					line astern. As they reached the southern edge of the airfield the wingmen began to formate on their leader
					and it was at this point that the collision occurred. The aircraft had been flying low, about 150 feet,
					and the pilot of this C-47, the lead aircraft, pulled up to gain altitude and started to turn to the left. The other plane [42-24028]
					was on the inside of the turn and slid into the leader. The two aircraft collided at an altitude of about
					400 feet above the terrain. Condemned 21Dec43.

					meant that Kuwait Oil (who were sponsoring the restoration project) had its
					assets frozen and therefore money dried up. The aircraft, next to G-BPMP and
					a very large number of spares were &quot;acquired&quot; by Air Atlantique who then sold
					the aircraft to Parkhouse Aviation in High Wycombe. However, serious corrosion was discovered,
					so they ended up reducing it to spares. When the aircraft was then broken up,
					the wings went to the US. This was carried out Apr 7, 1995. The nose section had a brief spell
					at the Mosquito Aircraft Museum at London Colney before moving on to the museum at Aalsmeerderbung in
					the Netherlands in November 1997. The aircraft itself was officially declared

					The aircraft were part of a three aircraft combined aerial gunnery and skip bombing mission.
					After take-off they proceeded to the skip bombing range to accomplish the first part of the mission.
					The other pilot was number two in the flight and this pilot was number three. They made one pass
					over the target and while in the base leg of the second pass, number three lost sight of his
					front man, who had his downwind base leg out further than necessary. He turned inside of him,
					and the aircraft collided in the turn at 1000 feet. Another pilot described the
					collision "I was firing on Range A and I had just pulled up from making a dry pass when I saw
					two planes collide. The first burst into flames and went down in several pieces. The second
					plane went straight down completely out of control."

					The aircraft took off for a dive-bombing practice mission on the Aberdeen bombing and
					gunnery range, 20 miles NW of Pocatello Field. After completing the mission the Thunderbolt
					suffered a loss of engine power. After spotting a flat potato field near the Snake River,
					the pilot radioed the tower that he was attempting a crash landing. Below, a farmer and
					his son were stocking a potato cellar near Firth, Idaho, and were startled by a whistling
					sound overhead. As the Thunderbolt passed over at about 50 feet of altitude, the pilot
					slid back the canopy and yelled, "I'm out of gas!". After gliding another quarter mile,
					the pilot was about to touch down when he suddenly banked to avoid hitting a farm house.
					The right wing clipped an irrigation canal embankment, and the aircraft slammed into the
					opposite side. The pilot was killed by the impact, and the aircraft was destroyed.

					The flight was returning from an aerial gunnery mission and was killing time to meet the landing
					schedule. They moved to a string formation and began a Luftbury Circle. This pilot was
					number four man of the formation. He was unable to hold his position and falling back,
					as the flight leader was closing in on #5, who tried to cut ahead of #4 in the turn.
					This plane cut the entire tail from the other plane. The pilot explained the collision
					"the aircraft ahead of me were leveling out from the turn and I was almost leveled out when an
					aircraft came up from underneath and my propeller cut his tail plane off. My engine started
					vibrating quite badly and smoking. A few seconds later, flames started coming out from the engine.
					I unhooked my harness, opened the canopy and jumped." Both aircraft crashed about 7½ miles southeast
					of Mays Landing. The plane crashed into a swamp and was abandoned where the wreckage was discovered in 1994.

					Milford, DE November 8, 1944. The formation training mission took the flight near the shoreline
					just off Milford, Delaware. The throttle stuck and, while the pilot's attention was
					directed to the throttle, he hit the water tearing off all four propeller blades. The
					plane skipped over the water tail first and came to rest wheels and flaps up in the
					shallow salt water. The pilot climbed out, inflated his dinghy and was later picked up
					by authorities from Dover Field.

					Shot down by flak over Clark Field, Philippines January 3, 1945; Pilot bailed out. The aircraft took
					off from Hill Airfield (Hammer) on Mindoro on a fighter sweep over Clark Field.
					The pilot went in to strafe the airfield. The Japanese put up a barrage of fire which the
					aircraft flew through, putting several holes in the wings. Despite being hit and not aware
					that the plane was on fire the pilot continued flying and saw a "Dinah" taking off.
					He turned 180 degrees and pursued the aircraft. He attacked when it was at 50 feet and shot
					it down without the Japanese pilot taking any evasive action. The pilot managed to bail out at
					low altitude and landed in a soft plowed field, roughly 200' from where his Thunderbolt crashed.
					Meeting a Filipino farmer and a young boy, he asked them where the Japanese were,
					then took off his shoes and began running in the opposite direction, away from Clark Field towards
					Mount Arayat. The pilot was followed by the Japanese for six or seven days, getting help from
					Filipinos who delayed the Japanese troops or gave them misinformation. On the seventh or eighth day,
					he observed a US Navy dive bomber crew bail out and asked the Filipinos to bring them to him.
					Together, they requested to join a guerrilla group in the area and were taken to the
					Hukbalahap ("Huks", Communist guerrillas) headquarters. Other American aviators joined them,
					totaling 28 men. Tipped off that they might be betrayed, they insisted the group be led to a
					secret American radio station near Akle run USAFFE guerrillas. After contacting FEAF,
					5th Fighter Command HQ, an area was cleared as a runway and Piper Cubs landed to fly out all 28 men.
				25420	(MSN 997)	69th FS, 58th FG, 5th AF; McGuire Field, San Jose, Mindoro, Philippines;
					Crashed in Sulu Sea off coast of Mindoro, Philippines January 22, 1945; Pilot MIA. MACR 11848.
					Late in the afternoon of January 22, 1945, the squadron sent out a four fighter patrol to cover
					the C-47 transports to Lingayen. When this fighter returned to base, San Jose was under
					a "red alert." The pilot reported in, called Elmore tower, and requested landing instructions.
					He was told to circle the area, as an unidentified aircraft was reported approaching San Jose.
					The last time the plane was seen was when it turned off its lights and headed out to sea.
					Mindoro radar station later reported having tracked an unidentified aircraft to zero degrees
					altitude about three to three and a half miles west to west south west of the mouth of
					Bugaganda River, Mindoro.

					Crash landed 27Apr44 after a loss of power at Apple Tree Farm, Copdock, Suffolk;
					Not long after takeoff and at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft the engine missed several
					times at intervals of about 30 seconds. Previous to this the pilot had switched to the
					belly fuel tank, not noticing that the fuel pressure remained constant and had been
					running on the same for at least a full minute. At the time the engine began missing
					he realized that the engine was losing power, so the pilot slid out of formation and
					went into a slight decline. At this moment the tachometer went down to zero in an even manner,
					rose to around two hundred rpm and dropped off again. He then pushed the propeller
					pitch full forward, also the throttle full forward giving a manifold pressure of
					40 inches and although the fuel pressure was 20 pounds, changed to main fuel tank.
					The airspeed was now down to 150 mph, and the fighter was steadily losing altitude which
					was but a few hundred feet. The pilot, realizing that he must make a forced landing,
					jettisoned bombs and belly tank and went directly in. The loss of power was not
					sudden but rather gradually diminishing and smooth. The pilot jettisoned his bombs,
					causing only minor damage to a garage roof. He then crash landed the aircraft at
					Red House Farm, Copdock, close by to Raydon.

					gaining any intelligence on this new model but photos show the aircraft intact when inspected
					by the Luftwaffe. The pilot, Francis S. Gabreski, the leading American air ace in Europe in World War II,
					evaded capture for 5 days but was eventually taken POW. Gabby' Gabreski downed 28 Messerschmitts and
					Focke-Wulfs over France and Germany between August 24, 1943, and July 5, 1944. He was captured on
					what was to have been his last mission and spent 10 months as a prisoner of war. He was a celebrity,
					and the War Department wanted him home to help sell war bonds. He was to depart from the air base at
					Boxted, England, on July 20 for 30 days' leave. But at the last moment, he asked to go along on a
					mission to escort B-24 Liberator bombers that would attack railroad yards near Frankfurt, Germany.
					After the bombers completed their run, he strafed an airfield seven miles west of Koblenz, but he
					came in too low, causing his propeller to hit the ground, which made the engine vibrate. He crash-landed
					in a wheat field, and after spending five days moving through the countryside, he was picked up by a
					farmer and turned over to German authorities. He retired from the AF as a colonel in 1967 after having
					served for three years as commander of the 52nd Fighter Interceptor Wing at Suffolk County AF Base in
					Westhampton Beach. The field, now a general-aviation airport owned by the county and used as well by
					the New York Air National Guard 106th Rescue Group, was subsequently renamed Francis S. Gabreski Airport.
					A plane with this serial number was displayed at Lackland AFB. Real serial was 44-89348,
					plane now correctly painted

					vertical on its nose. It remained at the airport until 1999 when it was salvaged by
					Robert Greinert / Historical Aircraft Restoration Society [HARS] and shipped to Sydney, Australia.
					During 2000, the fuselage was stored at the HARS facility near Sydney Airport (Mascot).
					Greinert planned to restore it to flying condition and use it as a template and model for the
					restoration of P-47D 42-8066. The aircraft was de-skinned and parts swapped with P-47D 42-27609
					to confuse the providence and export of each aircraft.

					During the late 1970s, the fuselage center section of this P-47 plus wings and tail section
					were stored in the garden of a house near Popondetta, Papua New Guinea. In 1999 it was salvaged by
					Robert Greinert / Historical Aircraft Restoration Society [HARS] and shipped to Sydney,
					Australia and stored until offered for sale. The aircraft was de-skinned and parts swapped
					with P-47D 42-27608 to confuse the providence and export of each aircraft. Later stored at
					Bankstown, NSW then Wollongong, NSW. As of 2013, it was acquired by Texas Flying Legends Museum,
					Ellington Field, Houston, who plan to restore this P-47 to flying status. During late 2014
					it was transported to Aircorps Aviation in Bemidji, MN. During January 2015, restoration
					was begun on the aircraft including tear down, part inventory and parts replacement.

					Damaged by flak, the engine failed while strafing tanks north of Rânes, France August 14, 1944.
					The pilot turned towards some American tanks to the south of the town but was forced to land in a
					field south of Le Mesnil-Angot, SE of Rânes. The field was too small, the aircraft touched down
					hard and slid at high speed towards a 3 metre high mound. The collision was violent, to such an
					extent that the aircraft leapt over the old Carrouges-Trun railway line. The propeller tore away,
					taking with it the front part of the engine that was later found 50 meters from the airframe.
					It is probable that the pilot was expelled from his cockpit and killed. The airplane finally
					stopped, balanced on the mound of the railway. In the immediate post-war period, the children
					of the Bisson and Menil-Angot hamlets used to play around the wreck of the Thunderbolt until
					it was salvaged by the scrap dealers. Clinging to the ends of the wings to move it from right
					to left or climbing on it, the plane quickly became a playground yet forbidden by their parents
					who saw the danger that constituted the eight machine guns and ammunition which were still installed.
					Fragments of the aircraft are on display at the Lashenden Air Warfare Museum, Kent, England. MACR 8505.

				28439 (MSN 2101) 366th FS [IA-K], 358th FG, 9th AF, Pontorson [A-28], France; After encountering thick
					cloud and avoiding collision with two other fighters, the pilot lost control of the aircraft
					which crashed with its load of bombs and exploded near Belleville farm, between Lamballe and
					Coëtmieux, France August 25, 1944. The pilot entered thick cloud and decided to climb immediately.
					He knew the possible risks of collision with another plane. He quickly reached 3,000 feet when,
					through a gap, he saw the leader and another pilot coming towards him. He pushed the throttle
					immediately to avoid his teammates and quickly emerged from this dangerous situation.
					He immediately undertook a reduction in his speed trying to stabilize his P-47. This maneuver
					unfortunately caused a violent stall of the plane which entered a spin. The plane began to
					vibrate everywhere. Finding himself lost, the pilot quickly unfastened the straps that
					secured him in his seat, he opened the canopy by pressing the electric contactor,
					hoping to evacuate his P-47 as quickly as possible and jump in the parachute. With the
					canopy open, he stepped over the left side of the cockpit. A strong wind projected him back
					inside. He was wounded slightly. The situation became critical as the heavy P-47 fell quickly.
					He attempted a new maneuver by throwing himself into the void, avoiding the empennage.
					After a free fall of a hundred meters, he pulled the opening handle of his parachute.
					This action shook him violently. As he descended, he saw below him his plane which had
					caught fire in flight, and which described a large arc to the left. The pilot landed
					heavily, was bruised and knocked out for a few minutes. The pilot was assisted by the local
					farmer who told him that the region had been liberated; he was repatriated by American forces
					same day and back at his unit by the end of that day.

					that his radio was not working or transmitting. Making "S turns" down the coast, the formation
					became strung out with Ki-43 Oscars observed in front of them, their first element,
					more Ki-43 Oscars, and more P-47s. An enemy aircraft was noted closing in on a crippled P-47.
					The fighter failed to rejoin the formation and was never seen again. Since there was no evidence
					of the aircraft crashing, there is a possibility the pilot bailed out or force landed. MACR 10025.

					and the crew hard a hard time fighting off numerous attacks. Eventually the fighters departed
					but the crew did not suffer any injuries. By now down to 7,000ft, the plane was vibrating badly
					with the No.4 propeller overspeeding. The order was given to bail out but before the airmen could
					depart, the propeller came off and the pilot was able to regain control. The pilot told the crew to
					prepare for a water landing and throw heavy equipment overboard. Now down almost at sea level, t
					he No.3 engine began to produce power and the bomber was able to regain some altitude. At this
					point another enemy fighter made numerous attacks; during one pass, a 20mm cannon shell hit the
					waist and exploded. Shrapnel fatally wounded the radio operator and the pilot was wounded.
					After the fighter departed, the crew took a little time to find their bearings but eventually made it to

					An enemy fighter attack damaged an elevator and the left wing, both of which were replaced.
					Over the target the No.4 engine was damaged losing all the oil, preventing the propeller from
					being feathered which windmilled on the return to base. Failed to return from a tactical
					mission in support of Operation Husky to the Messina-Villa San Giovanni ferry terminals,
					Italy 16Jul43 (3WIA:7RTD). After leaving the target, the pilot descended to spoil the flak
					gunners' range. Two flak bursts directly in front of the bomber cut control cables to the tail
					and the plane rolled out of formation. The pilot selected the autopilot and the plane
					straightened up but was difficult to control. No.2 engine was disabled and No.3 propeller
					was overspeeding; it could not be feathered and soon fell off. The two waist gunners had
					serious injuries and another airmen had been hit by shrapnel. The plane lost altitude as an
					airman managed to splice the broken control cables giving the pilot lateral control. British
					Spitfire fighters showed up and gave much needed protection to the bomber. Unwilling to
					order the crew to bail out or ditch the plane with wounded aboard, the pilot decided not to
					head over water to Malta but flew south along the east coast of Sicily, hoping to crash landed
					inside recently liberated territory. Past Syracuse, near Cape Passero, the pilot spotted what
					appeared to be a level stretch of sandy beach and turned to line up for a landing. At this moment
					the repaired control cables failed leving the pilot with only engine throttles and a weak autopilot
					for control. Crash landed in about three feet of water in a lake, stopping 300 yards from shore,
					about five miles behind the British front lines in Sicily. The 'beach' had been mud crusted over
					a bog five feet deep. The crew was rescued and given medical assistance by British troops.

					Crashed after the crew bailed out after becoming lost over Idaho 30Mar43 (1KIS). The bomber took
					off from Walla Walla Field for a local instrument navigation training flight. The weather closed in
					south of Pendleton, OR, and the crew became lost. The radio compass malfunctioned, and it was
					discovered that the navigator's compass had been removed from the aircraft. The control tower
					at Walla Walla Field instructed the crew to attempt reaching Gowen Field at Boise, ID, where
					visibility had improved. En route, they found the bomb bay fuel tank had not been filled before
					takeoff. Carburetor and wing icing became an issue as the weather worsened. Later the crew
					realized they wouldn't be able to reach Boise, so the pilot set the aircraft on autopilot and
					ordered the crew to bail out. All nine men bailed out over the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in
					remote wilderness. The aircraft circled for several minutes until the fuel was exhausted and
					it struck a mountain twenty-five miles south east of Challis, ID. Eight of the nine airmen survived
					deep snow and freezing temperatures for over a week by following the river and staying in
					abandoned cabins. Rescue came after one of them figured out how to climb a pole and close the
					switch for a ranger station telephone. The flight engineer was never found, and it was assumed
					that either his parachute failed to open or he drowned in the river. Salvaged 19May43.

					Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to
					enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration
					and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal support but
					they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for themselves
					on the return trip. It proved to be the most disastrous of the 303rd Bomb Group combat missions
					flown to date. The 303rd lost eleven of the forty B-17s flying the mission. Luftwaffe attacks started

					(Station 121), Cambridgeshire 19Apr43. Named 'Mary Ruth, Memories of Mobile'
					Named for the pilot's wife. When the crew arrived in Mobile they stayed at the Battlehouse Hotel
					in downtown Mobile. The pilot and another crew member were having a drink in the hotel lounge
					and started talking to the two women sitting at the next table. Mary Ruth King and her friend did
					sheet-metal work repairing planes at Brookley Field. The pilot, Loren Roll, and Mary Ruth hit it off
					immediately. Loren proposed after a few days; they were married at Dauphin Way Baptist Church
					one week after they met. For those interested in non significant triva, the serial number of the "Mary Ruth"
					was Mary Ruth King's phone number in Mobile at the time she met Loren
					Failed to return from a mission to the Chemische Werke synthetic rubber works at Hüls, Marl,
					Germany 22Jun43 (8POW:2KIA). Attacked by enemy fighters en route to the target setting No.4 engine
					on fire, damaged the flight controls and disabled the electrical system. The plane dropped out
					of formation and was further attacked with a 20mm cannon shell doing further damage in the cockpit.
					The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The bombardier worked on the shackle mechanisms of two
					bombs with a screwdriver, eventually causing them to fall free; this allowed the forward crew to
					escape by squeezing around the remaining bombs. Before all the crew could bail out, the outer
					wing blew off throwing the plane into a spinning downward dive, the centrifugal force of which
					prevented the remaining crew from leaving the plane. Almost immediately thereafter the bomber
					exploded, ejecting all but the radio operator and a waist gunner who remained trapped within the
					falling fuselage. Crashed near Wulfen, five miles north of Dorsten, Germany. {7 missions}
					Claimed by Obfw Hans Laun in Fw 190A-5 of JG 1/1.

					Field, WA 24May43. Air Service Command, Tinker Field, Oklahoma City, OK 3Dec43. 843rd Bomb Squadron,
					488th Bomb Group, MacDill Field, Tampa, FL. Crashed six miles northeast Hillsborough, FL 29Feb44 (9KIS).
					The aircraft took off late on 28Feb44 from MacDill Field, Tampa, Florida, on a local instrument flight and
					bombing mission with ten men aboard. After takeoff the airplane climbed to 22,000ft. Later, the MacDill Field
					control tower radioed the subject airplane and advised the pilot to return to the local area, and to stay
					tuned to the tower frequency. The airplane let down to an unknown altitude and flew around locally.
					At this time, the pilot contacted the ball turret gunner and asked him if he would like to get some stick time.
					The gunner had logged over 500 hours of flying time in small civilian airplanes and after putting his bombs
					on safe, went forward and replaced the engineer who was then sitting in the pilot's seat. The co-pilot was
					sitting in his own seat. In a minute or two, the pilot came forward and replaced the co-pilot in his seat.
					At his request, the gunner made several turns in the airplane. Then the pilot told him to head for MacDill
					Field and start letting down. This was done in the direction of a group of lights then thought by the crew to
					be MacDill Field. At 1,000ft, the pilot took over the controls and put the wheels down. Some little trouble
					was experienced determining as to wether or not the left wheel was down, during which time both the
					gunner and pilot were looking out the left window. At this point, the pilot had the gunner change positions
					with him, taking the pilot's seat. At this point, no more lights were visible and the altimeter was dropping
					past 800 feet slowly. Within one or two minutes after the pilot resumed his station, the bomber hit something
					and shortly thereafter contacted the ground. Fire broke out immediately and the gunner went out
					through the pilot's window, extinguishing the flames on his clothes by rolling in the sand. He was the
					only survivor of the crash, that occured early on the 29th six miles northeast of Hillsborough Army Air Field,
					Tampa, Florida. The wreckage was not found until daylight hours. Investigation of the wreckage and
					surrounding terrain indicated that the bomber cut a path through trees while in a bank to the left.
					The B-17 cartwheeled into the terrain, broke up and burst into flames. Wreckage was scattered from
					south to north over a semi-wooded area for a distance of 520 yards. Investigators speculated that
					the pilot had mistaken Hillsborough Army Air Field for MacDill Field. They acknowledged the value
					of having a crew member with flying experience on board during combat missions, but it was tolerated
					to let such crew members to occasionally fly in the co-pilot's seat only, and only during ideal daylight conditions.

					Force landed at Steeple Morden (Station 122), Cambridgeshire on one and a half engines and a flat tyre.
					Failed to return from a mission to the Bosch magneto factory at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43 (3MIA:1WIA:6RTD).
					From the Initial Point until leaving the target area, there was a complete undercast except for small
					sparse patches of farm land. This group went over the target area twice without dropping their bombs. B
					ombs were finally dropped on Achern, a small town 18km southwest of Baden-Baden, Germany.
					Having spent too long over the target, the formation was beginning to realise that fuel exhaustion
					would likely lead to many not being able to return to base. With fuel exhaustion, ditched in the English
					Channel east of Hastings, Sussex, sinking within seconds. The landing damaged the plane so that the
					release levers for the dinghy stowages could not be pulled. Some of the Mae Wests failed to operate.
					All airmen evacuated the plane with minor bruises. Seven were rescued within twenty minutes
					by mine layers but three were lost at sea. MACR 515.

					the plane had been hit hard in an attack by enemy fighters on the bomb run and the No.1 engine
					was on fire, the pilot kept it in position over the target. As soon as the Group turned off the target and
					was just beyond the edge of the flak barrage, more enemy aircraft came in to attack. A 20mm cannon
					shell struck the nose throwing Plexiglas into the face of the bombardier, causing severe, profusely
					bleeding, wounds. The navigator who had also suffered wounds in both legs and his shoulder, told
					the bombardier that he needed immediate medical attention and should bail out. He then helped him
					out the nose hatch. Although alive when he left the aircraft, the bombardier did not survive.
					The navigator then went up into the cockpit to help the pilot fly the plane. They flew along for about
					five minutes when more fighters came at them. The plane took a direct 20mm cannon shell hit that
					knocked out all the controls. The pilot rang the bail-out bell, went down to the nose hatch and bailed out.

					and ferry terminal at Bizerte, Tunisia 3May43 (10RTD). This plane became separated from the Group in
					poor visibility but found and joined the 99th Bomb Group formation. The pilot did not drop the bombs
					because the flight leaders of the formation did not drop theirs. With weather deteriorating, the
					99th Group Flight Leader advised the pilot to head for the ocean or the desert and bail out; he chose
					to try to make it back to base. Somewhere just south of Constantine, he jettisoned the bombs against
					the side of a hill. Five minutes later, while searching for a place to land, the plane hit a high tension
					line along a road, damaging the right aileron. The pilot cut the number one engine to offset the right
					drag on the plane, headed for the first open field and crash landed. The number one engine caught fire,
					but was put out by the crew, assisted by soldiers in the area, who came to the scene with fire extinguishers.
					The crash was in the vicinity of the 46th Quartermaster Corps, 2nd Battalion Headquarter's dispensary
					near Ouled Rahmoun, about fifteen miles south of Constantine, Algeria. The airplane was damaged
					beyond repair but the crew was uninjured. The airplane was turned over to the executive officer of
					the nearby Quartermaster unit. He was advised of the confidential equipment on board and agreed
					to maintain a guard over the wreckage until Air Force personnel could come to salvage parts.

					Dow Field, Bangor, ME to Fort Dix AAB, Wrightstown, NJ when it crashed on Kittatinny Mountain,
					Millbrook, NJ 22Feb44 (11KIS). For awhile after takeoff, the plane had been in radio communication
					with a second plane also bound for Fort Dix, but something went wrong with the receiving equipment
					of this B-17. As the flight progressed on course homeward, the B-17 confirmed passage over markers
					at Port Chester, NY, and Newark, NJ. But shortly after the plane reported reaching the Metuchen NJ marker,
					its communications ceased, possibly the effect of ice forming on the plane's radio antennas. By the time
					the B-17 reached the Delaware Valley the plane was off course by miles, probably due to weather-related
					failure of its navigation gear. Visual navigation was also drastically hindered by the heavy fog, snow,
					sleet and icy conditions. As the plane was heard circling over Bushkill, PA, it seemed to be experiencing
					trouble. The huge bomber then turned eastward toward Millbrook, NJ, where it continued circling,
					apparently trying to descend below the dense fog. As the plane flew low over Millbrook, the fog was
					heavy and the plane could not be easily seen. The noise of the engines sounded so close that the
					residents thought it would crash near their houses. Moments later they heard a terrific collision
					somewhere up on the ridge, followed by a powerful explosion. The plane had hit the tree tops
					near the top of the 1,400-foot Kittatinny Ridge, shearing off large trees as it cut a swath through
					the woods nearly a quarter mile long before finally hitting the ground, causing its fuel tanks to rupture.
					The impact was so great that the plane's engines were buried deep in the frozen earth, and the burning
					wreckage was strewn over an area covering several hundred feet along the Appalachian Trail. Salvaged 27Feb44

					from a mission to railway marshalling yards at Foggia, Italy 31May43. The plane flew back to
					base keeping about fifty feet above the water. The crew was relaxed, having a smoke. The
					navigator had gone aft to the toilet when suddenly the waist gunner opened up with his gun.
					Between the waist gunners there suddenly appeared a cloud of smoke; it was from a 20mm
					cannon shell fired by a German fighter that had entered through the navigator's Plexiglas nose.
					He was lucky. Running back from the toilet he saw where the shell had entered and all he could do
					was point at the hole where his head would have been and he turned white. Another shell had
					dug along the floor, peppered the instrument panel and knocked out the electrical system. Another
					shell disabled No.1 engine. The plane clung to the sea, as close as it could, while the Germans
					dropped 100kg demolition bombs in front, hoping the plane would fly into water spouts and
					crash. The bomber was about twenty miles off the coast and fairly close to home base when
					they attacked. Aïn M'lila (Onyx), Constantine, Algeria 17Jun43. Massicault, Tunis, Tunisia 1Aug43.

					(first combat mission 22Jun43}. Failed to return from a mission to the Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac,
					Bordeaux, France 31Dec43 (11POW). The target was covered by smoke and cloud so the group
					diverted to the secondary target, a Luftwaffe airfield at Châteaubernard, Cognac, France.
					Intelligence reports indicated that very little opposition could be expected from this target,
					but unknown to the Americans, a Luftwaffe Flak unit had just completed their training at a
					gunnery school at St. Nazaire and were being transported to their new assignments.
					They, along with their guns, were on railway trucks close to the airfield, the gunners
					watching in amazement as the bombers headed towards them following the railway lines!
					Added to this was the fact that because of the supposed weak opposition expected, the bomber
					force had descended to a lower altitude to ensure pin-point accuracy with their bombing,
					thus presenting the Germans with a target they just could not fail to miss. The group headed
					over the target and immediately came under intense and deadly accurate anti-aircraft fire
					but continued to hold their course and releasing their bomb load. Badly damaged by a
					flak shell which exploded close by, disabling one engine, the electrical and oxygen systems.
					Several other aircraft were badly hit and the formation broke up, with crippled bombers
					desperately trying to get away from the flak barrage. Having cleared the target area the
					bombers headed west, encountering some more flak from barges moored in the Gironde estuary,
					but then they were clear of the coast over the Bay of Biscay and on their way home.
					The formation was beginning its return flight across the Brest Peninsula and again came under
					attack, this time from German fighters. The bomber received more hits which resulted in the
					loss of a second engine, thereby further reducing airspeed and, consequently, continued
					to lose altitude at a steady rate. The strong headwinds too were having a serious effect on
					its performance, and, as they passed over the North Brittany coast, it became all too obvious
					that ther would not be sufficient fuel left to complete the English Channel crossing. As they
					headed out over the water, the pilot gave the order to lighten the plane and the crew threw
					out everything that was detachable such as machine-guns, radio tuning units, frequency meters
					and flak suits. Coming up to the island of Guernsey, the pilot decided to put down as close as
					possible to the shore to afford his crew the best chance of being rescued albeit by the enemy.
					Now down to a few hundred feet above the waves, suddenly a new hazard faced the crew. German
					radar had been tracking the bomber and having passed on the information, the coastal
					defences as well as the Luftwaffe light and medium flak and the 2cm guns at Batterie Steinbruch
					at Les Vardes, opened fire on the crippled aircraft and subjected it to an intense barrage
					as it sank slowly towards the sea. Although the plane may have been hit, the crew escaped
					injury. The plane ditched off the west coast of Guernsey, Channel Islands. The crew escaped
					the sinking bomber, which quickly broke in two and sank and were ultimately rescued by
					German troops and taken prisoner. {30 missions) MACR 1985. 11 POW.

					their Fortress as the 'ex-Virgin'. Battle damaged on a mission to the ball bearing factories
					at Schweinfurt, Germany 17Aug43 (1KIA). Just after the fighter escort returned home,
					the bomber was attacked by enemy fighters with two 20mm cannon shells disabling the
					left side oxygen system and intercom, and killing the left waist gunner. With smoke swirling
					around inside the rear fuselage, four crew members bailed out. But the bomber was still under
					control and continued to the target. The bombs would not release, their controls having been
					damaged by flak. They were eventually manually released over another target on the way home.
					With most of the fabric tail surfaces shredded and failing engine power, the bomber was
					beginning to suffer with fuel exhaustion. The pilot coaxed the bomber as far as the Belgian
					coast and hoped that the fuel would last until the crew could at least be rescued by Allied sailors.

					dropping behind formation. The pilot of B-17 42-30319 circled and put #646 in front of it for
					protection from enemy fighters expected at any time. #646 was directly below #319 and
					losing altitude, getting closer and closer to the water. The pilot of #646 ditched into the sea.
					He brought the tail down first and then the nose just dropped; the plane sank instantly.
					The pilot of #319 circled around the crashed plane and nine men were counted in the water.
					He told the crew to drop life rafts, which they did. One raft turned bottom up and the other
					looked half inflated. At this time, the men in the water were scattering all around, there were
					three men in one place and about 200 feet away was another one, and about 300 feet
					were the rest. One man was seen to swim for the raft but the water was very rough.
					#319 was running low on fuel so headed for the nearest airfield. There it refueled and
					took on more life rafts. It came back to where #646 had crashed and where the crew
					dropped the rafts. After spending some time searching, the crew could not see them
					or the rafts. The pilot decided they should return to the airfield where they refueled and
					continued the search the following morning. After another search and dropping a smoke
					bomb marker, #319 departed when a boat was seen heading towards the location.

					Battle damaged on a mission to the U-boat base and shipyard at Saint-Nazaire,
					France 1May43 (3KIA:7RTD). Several of the bombers failed to rendezvous as intended,
					and others had mechanical problems and had to turn back. The middle portion of the
					bombing mission went well, with no German fighters engaging the mission until after
					they had released their bomb loads. The bombers managed to drop their payload on
					target with little resistance from the Germans in occupied France. As the fighters
					came up, the bombing group managed to elude them by flying into a large cloud bank.
					On the return route a navigational error took the entire formation at low level over the
					Brest peninsula where heavy flak fired from navy flak boats fragmented the group.
					German fighters arrived on the scene, quickly exploited the situation and began
					concerted attacks. The pilot began to descend to 2,000ft and was almost immediately
					overtaken by several German fighters and intense anti-aircraft fire. The bomber was hit,
					rupturing the fuel tanks and igniting a massive fire in the center of the fuselage.
					The damage to the aircraft was severe, knocking out communications and compromising
					the fuselage's integrity. Staff Sergeant Maynard Smith's ball turret lost power and he
					scrambled out to assist the other crew members. Three crew members bailed out,
					while Smith tended to two others who were seriously wounded. In between helping his
					wounded comrades, Smith also manned the 0.50 caliber machine guns and fought
					the raging fire. The heat from the fire was so intense that it had begun to melt the
					metal in the fuselage, threatening to break the plane in half. For nearly ninety minutes,
					Smith alternated between shooting at the attacking fighters, tending to his wounded
					crew members and fighting the fire. To starve the fire of fuel, he threw burning debris
					and exploding ammunition through the large holes that the fire had melted in the fuselage.
					After the fire extinguishers were exhausted, Smith finally managed to put the fire out,
					in part by urinating on it. The bomber reached England and force landed at Predannack,
					Cornwall where it broke in half as it touched down. It had been hit with more than
					3,500 bullets and pieces of shrapnel. Mobile Repair Unit, Eighth Air Force Service

					returned home out over the North Sea near Heligoland Island, Luftwaffe fighter
					command experimented with a new tactic to disrupt American bomber formations,
					aerial bombing. Oberleutnant Heinz Knoke of II./JG 11 flying a Bf 109G-6 maneuvered
					his fighter 3,000ft above the 91st Bomb Group formation. Slung between the
					undercarriage on his plane was a 500 pound bomb armed with a 15-second timed fuse.
					Lt. Knoke slowly edged his fighter forward until he was directly over the front of the
					bomber formation. He pressed the release, the bomb fell free, hurtled downwards
					and exploded near one of the Fortresses. This bomber was in the path of the
					exploding bomb. A wing crumpled, the aircraft began spiralling downward. In spite
					of their efforts, the two pilots were unable to regain control of the plane as it
					began breaking apart. All the crewmen were trapped by centrifugal forces.

					Attacked by a large force of enemy fighters and flak over the target area was very intense.
					As the bomber approached the target, flak knocked out the No.1 engine. Minutes later,
					just after the bombardier had called out "bomb release", a burst of flak killed the No.4 engine,
					leaving it windmilling out of control. On two engines, the B-17 dropped out of formation
					ecame the target of an assortment of enemy fighters who lined up 10 deep to get a shot
					at the crippled bomber. Cannon shells and bullets tore into the fuselage, seriously
					ing the tail gunner and radio operator and cutting several of the control cables.
					The waist and turret gunners poured.50-caliber shells back at the attackers,

					Named *Lamesa Lass/Dearly Beloved*) Failed to return from a mission
					to the submarine yards at Wilhelmshaven, Germany 21May43 (9RTD). Turning away after
					the target heavy flak burst under the plane and appeared to damage the superchargers on
					No.1 and 2 engines. The plane dropped out of formation and was attacked by enemy fighters.
					By cutting the corner and using increased power on the other two engines, the plane regained
					the formation. Crossing the coast on the exit, the No.4 engine oil pressure dropped and the
					plane fell out of formation again. The group slowed down and this plane caught up once
					more. But then the No.2 propeller oversped, slowing the plane down again. The No.4 propeller
					was feathered but the engine continued to lose oil and the oxygen sytem was depleted.
					A swarm of enemy fighters attacked as the bomber was slowly losing height. The No.4
					engine was hit by 20mm cannon shells; the No.2 engine was also hit, the cowling being
					shot away and a fire started. The plane was now riddled with holes from flak and cannon
					shells. With only one good engine, the pilot managed to take evasive action. Several fires
					were started by enemy cannon shells but the crew extinguished them. A hole in an elevator
					was causing control problems and it was obvious that the plane would not make it across
					the North Sea to England. Out of ammunition, a couple of fresh enemy fighters continued to
					attack; the tail was almost dismembered and there were many holes in the wings and nose.
					The pilot made the decision to ditch in a calm sea rather than turn round and bail out over
					enemy territory. The bomber was ditched in North Sea, the crew evacuating onto a wing until
					the life raft s were ready. The plane stayed afloat for several minutes until the tail rose up
					and it sank slowly beneath the waves. A Royal Air Force Wellington bomber spotted the airmen
					late that night and provided a location fix for rescue. Heavy fog the following morning
					precluded an Air-Search and made it difficult and time-consuming for surface craft but the c
					rew was rescued by Royal Navy rescue launch that afternoon.

					bombers were converging on his. He chose to dive out of formation down to 13,000ft.
					The bomb doors had failed to close and the engineer was sent back to manually close them to
					reduce drag. Enemy fighters closed in on the lone bomber and the pilot dived again to escape.
					The engineer, without his parachute, was thrown off-balance towards the open bomb bay but
					managed to hang on hanging out into space until the plane levelled off and he could climb
					back in. 20mm cannon shells demolished the radio equipment and wounded two crew members.
					With the left waist gun operating normally, the pilot slewed the bomber to the right when fighters
					attacked to give the gunner the best chance of a hit. The fighters then changed tactics and
					attacked the tail. A 20mm cannon shell knocked the tail gunner back against the door but he
					recovered and manged to shoot down one fighter. Both gunners were wounded but the waist
					gunner also managed to shoot down an enemy fighter. A 20mm cannon shell had taken off a
					chink of propeller tip, causing vibrations through the bomber and the crew preparing
					to bail out. The pilot managed to reduce the vibration and the bomber limped home to a
					safe landing at Chelveston. The tail gunner received the DSC for his actions.

					was attacked by enemy fighters. Flak punctured a fuel tank and the nose section
					was badly damaged. In poor weather, the plane became separated from the main
					formation. Not sure of his position, the pilot turned north knowing that he would
					soon be over the English Channel heading for England. Leaking fuel from the enemy
					damage, the pilot headed across southern England and came to Whitchurch airfield
					on the outskirts of Bristol. With fuel exhaustion, the pilot force landed at Whitchurch,
					a civilian airfield used by BOAC and KLM. After refuelling, the plane departed for
					Bassingbourn later the same day. Battle damaged on a mission to the Deutsche Schiff-
					und Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft (Deschimag) shipyard at Bremen, Germany 8Oct43.
					The formation was met with stiff resistance by German fighters and flak crews on the
					ground the entire way, from the Dutch coast all the way into the German heartland.
					In addition, a large force of German fighters launched vicious attacks against the planes.
					Over the target, the formation encountered intense flak. The plane was full of holes
					from flak and bullets. Failed to return from a mission to the Arado Flugzeugwerke
					aircraft factory, Anklam, Prussia 9Oct43 (3MIA:7KIA). The formation was attacked
					by a large force of Luftwaffe fighters soon after it crossed the coast. They followed
					all the way in, attacking on the bomb run and over the target. Before approaching the
					target, the propeller of number three engine was feathered, causing the plane to fall
					back about a thousand yards. It caught up with the engine going again but as it was
					readying for the target run, the same propeller was feathered again and the plane
					started losing altitude. As soon as the plane was hit, it caught on fire and started down.
					Three airmen bailed out but their parachutes were on fire. Crashed in the Baltic Sea,
					about eight miles east of Gedser off the Danish island of Falster, Denmark. MACR 894

					mining complex at Knaben, Norway 16Nov43. En route to Norway, still over water,
					in and out of broken clouds, and out of sight of land, the number one engine
					developed an oil leak and, without an oil reserve, it was necessary to feather
					the propeller before it seized. Unable to keep up with the group, and liable to
					be attacked by enemy fighters, the pilot turned back to England. On its way back,
					the plane descended to a lower altitude and levelled off on top of the cloud layer.
					The bombs were jettisoned into the North Sea then the engine seized. It shuddered,
					there was a loud bang and the engine stopped. The propeller then spun freely at
					maximum flat pitch. A Luftwaffe Ju 88 bomber appeared; simultaneously, the two
					planes dove into the clouds and the German was not seen again. Flying across the
					North Sea above the clouds, its location was confirmed when an English anti-aircraft
					battery opened fire on the unidentified bomber as it crossed the coast in the vicinity
					of The Wash. The pilot took evasive action as the crew attempted to fire flares of the
					colour of the day. Flying inland, a Royal Air Force Bristol Beaufighter came out of the
					clouds ahead to intercept the bomber. The Beaufighter circled around and took up
					position off the right wing. It gave no indication of recognition or response to the flares
					from the bomber. Gunners were instructed to take NO action and to not even move
					their guns. The bomber continued its flight to Bassingbourn and the Beaufighter didn't go
					until the bomber had landed. Battle damaged on a mission to the port area at Bremen,
					Germany 13Dec43 (1WIA:9RTD). Over the target flak was moderate and accurate,
					shrapnel wounding a gunner. Severely battle damaged on a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke

					20Feb44 (2WIA:8RTD). Cloud cover hid the target and the group diverted to an alternate
					target, the industrial areas of Oschersleben, Germany. Flak was moderate and accurate
					leading up to the target. Having released the bombs and with the bomb doors still open,
					a flak shell exploded below the bomb bay, seriously wounding the bombardier and
					ball gunner. The right rudder control cables had been severed and the engine superchargers
					were malfunctioning. Hydraulic pumps were inoperative and the electrical system was

					En route to the target area, the bomber formation was repeatedly attacked by a large
					number of Luftwaffe fighters. An enemy fighter attacked the bomber before reaching the
					target, disabling one of the engines. Later, an attack by three Bf 109s wounded the ball
					turret gunner as the bomber pilot headed for the cover of some clouds. The pilot offered
					the option of heading for Switzerland, bailing out over Germany or try heading for home.
					The crew agreed to try and make it back to England so the pilot dropped down to tree top
					level and raced along despite poor visibility. Over France, the bomber was struck by
					machine guns and light flak which tore a big hole in the side of the cockpit, fatally wounding
					the pilot. The visibility was getting worse and the bomber clipped a tall tree, smashing the
					Plexiglas nose. Crossing the French coast, the bomber was again struck by flak, setting fire
					to an engine. Nearing fuel exhaustion and with the engine still burning, the bomber reached
					the south coast of England and safely landed, despite a flat tire, at RAF Tangmere, Chichester,
					West Sussex, slamming into a tree. When the badly damaged Fortress was repaired and
					returned to service, the crew painted 'Corn State Terror' on the nose in memory of the pilot.

					Northamptonshire 17Apr43. On the 13May43, the aircraft took off from Grafton
					Underwood on a mission to Saint-Omer, France. The crew had been warned about
					the possibility of being attacked while taking off or landing. Consequently, the
					machine guns were charged. When the pilot banked the aircraft during the Group
					assembly, the right waist gun discharged about 50 rounds resulting in the
					aircraft's right horizontal stabiliser being shot off and cutting the control cable
					to the right aileron. The tail gunner and a waist gunner had been wounded by this action.
					The damage was so severe, the aircraft was very difficult to fly but was brought back
					over base where six crew bailed out. The pilots then took the aircraft towards the
					coast where the bombs and armament were jettisoned over The Wash, then turning
					back over land so that the bombadier and navigator could bail out safely near
					King's Lynn. Next, the pilot and co-pilot took their crippled plane back out to sea to
					ditch it away from built-up areas. They both bailed out somewhere off Blakeney, Norfolk.
					The co-pilot was picked up by an RAF rescue launch. The pilot had been in the freezing
					North Sea for some time before the Sheringham Lifeboat found him, unconscious.
					He did not survive (1KIA). The bomber was discovered 72 years later by the North

					En route to the target and flying over the North Sea, the spare element leader was

					the spare element was attacked by four Bf 109 fighters. Poor weather conditions over the
					primary target forced the formation to hit an alternate target, a Luftwaffe airfield at Achmer,
					Bramsche, Germany. The weather was poor that day, and things went wrong from the start.
					The First Bombardment Wing had no pathfinder aircraft; the fighter escort failed to meet
					them at the rendezvous point, and just as the large formation came to a place deep inside
					enemy territory where they needed to make a turn they flew into a large cloudbank.
					Coming out, the plane was attacked from the nose and tail by enemy fighters.
					The pilot pushed right rudder as hard as he could and caused the plane to skid to the
					right. The line of fire from the fighter came down between the number 2 engine and the
					fuselage. It took a bullet in the number 2 fuel tank and a 20mm cannon shell in the
					left horizontal stabilizer. There were also several holes in the tail cone. {final combat

					{first combat mission 10Jul43}. Battle damaged on a mission to bomb a submarine suppy ship
					in the Loire River at Nantes, France 16Sep43. There was moderate and accurate flak from
					Rennes but at Nantes the flak was moderate and inaccurate. A large force of enemy fighters
					was encountered. On return, force landed at RAF St Athan, South Wales. {19 missions 384BG}.
					Failed to return from a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical works at Leverkusen, Germany 1Dec43
					(8POW:2EVD). Clouds obscured the target so the formation diverted to the secondary target, a non-
					ferrous metals works at Solingen, Germany. Damaged by flak which struck No.2 engine, the propeller
					of which could not be feathered and was spinning fast creating much vibration. Returning to base,
					the aircraft lost speed because of headwinds and the aircraft was attacked by four Bf 109 fighters
					of 4./JG 26. The No.3 engine was struck by cannon shells. Still losing altitude, a P-47 Thunderbolt
					kept the enemy away for a while but after it had to leave, the enemy returned and destroyed a
					third engine. The pilot lowered the landing gear with the intention of landing but with further
					engine failure ordered the crew to bail out. The crew members bailed out, one landed near
					Boeschepe (Nord), France, some others landing near Abele, Belgium, and the rest near Westouter,
					Belgium. These locations are all within four miles south and west of Poperinge, Belgium.
					This B-17 was being tailed by another B-17 which didn't come close, nor was it hit by the
					very accurate flak, the suggestion being that it may have been a captured aircraft flown
					by the Luftwaffe. The aircraft crashed near Zwarteberg/Mont Noir on the Belgian-French
					border, SW of Ypres, Belgium. Listed shot down by Lt Hans-Joachim
					Rettig in Me 410A of ZG 26/5 Dec 1, 1943 on mission to Solingen, Germany

					Failed to return from a mission to the port area of Bremen, Germany 29Nov43 (1KIA:8MIA:1POW).
					The tail gunner, the lone survivor, states that the plane was not hit over Germany while on their
					bombing mission to Bremen; it was shot down over the Netherlands by ground fire. German 88mm
					Anti-Aircraft guns were present and by flying low, the pilot thought to avoid them. The plane was
					hit by ground fire and ditched a few hundred yards off the shore at Petten, Netherlands.
					Bouncing off the waves, the plane broke in two and sank quickly. Some crew members
					managed to escape but others were trapped in the wreckage. Two German fighters
					showed up after the landing; they circled above the bomber but didn't fire.
					At least four crew members climbed into a dinghy and a few others were floating with
					their life jackets on in the sea. It was tidal and the sea was rough. German forces on
					land thought the men in the raft were about to open fire. The Germans opened fire with
					small arms killing some of the crew. A German lieutenant on the shore halted the fire
					once he realized the men in the raft were not firing. He and a local civilian tied ropes
					to themselves and swam out to rescue any survivors, no small task given the water conditions.
					 The tail gunner succumbed to the cold water and was unconscious for four days;
					he was rescued and brought to shore by the German lieutenant. This lieutenant saved his life
					at the risk of his own, something the gunner probably never knew. He was taken to a local building
					converted to a hospital. Locals contemplated a rescue attempt but the Germans had him
					thoroughly guarded. The other crew members were killed by the small arms fire or drowned.
					The 'Wilder Nell II' was claimed to have been shot down by Oblt. Erich Bucholz in a Bf 109 who
					claimed the victory. This is unsubstantiated and does not match witness accounts.
					The aircraft was inspected by Germans after the crash. As the tide moved in and out, it was washed out to sea.

					Named "Ruthie II". Severely battle damaged on a mission to synthetic rubber
					factories at Hanover, Germany 26Jul43. Several crew members including the pilot
					were injured or unconscious with lack of oxygen. Prior to reaching the German
					coast on the way to the target, the bomber was attacked by a large force of enemy
					fighters, during which the oxygen system to the tail, waist, and radio gun
					positions was knocked out. A frontal attack placed a cannon shell through the
					windshield, totally shattering it, and the pilot's skull was split open by a 0.303
					caliber shell, leaving him in a crazed condition. The pilot fell over the steering
					wheel, tightly clamping his arms around it. The co-pilot at once grasped the
					controls from his side and, by sheer strength, pulled the airplane back into formation
					despite the frantic struggles of the semi-conscious pilot. The interphone had been
					destroyed, rendering it impossible to call for help. At this time The engineer/top turret
					gunner fell to the floor and down through the hatch with his arm shot off at the shoulder
					and a gaping wound in his side. The waist, tail, and radio gunners had lost consciousness
					from lack of oxygen and, hearing no fire from their guns, the co-pilot believed they had
					bailed out. The wounded pilot still offered desperate resistance in his crazed attempts
					to fly the airplane. There remained the prospect of flying to and over the target and
					back to a friendly base wholly unassisted. In the face of this desperate situation,
					the co-pilot made his decision to continue the flight and protect any members of the
					crew who might still be in the plane and for two hours he flew in formation with one
					hand at the controls and the other holding off the struggling pilot before the navigator
					entered the cockpit and relieved the situation. On return to England, force landed at

					Failed to return from a mission to the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43
					(4KIA:6POW). En route to the target area, the bomber formation was repeatedly attacked
					by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters. As the bomber was nearing Schweinfurt from the
					west, a Luftwaffe Bf 109G-6 fighter flown by Uffz Robert Meyer-Ahrend of JJG 3/8 attacked it. Ahrend
					shot out an engine and the bomber pilot had to shut down a second damaged one shortly
					thereafter, but the B-17 kept flying for just a little longer. Then Ahrend was forced to
					leave the crippled B-17 because it had entered Schweinfurt's dangerous flak zone. The bomber
					left formation as the pilots fought with the unresponsive controls but the bombardier
					managed to drop the bombs somewhere over Schweinfurt. Right after bomb release, the
					plane was suddenly hit very hard in the rear by flak. The tail section and perhaps also the
					right fuselage wing root were so severely damaged by the exploding flak shell that the
					pilot knew that he had no chance of flying home or even keeping control any longer. The right
					wing root was bending visibly and making creaking noises and the whole right wing
					was loosely flapping and oscillating like it was just about to break off, but the resilient B-17
					kept on flying for vital seconds. It got them away from the built-up city of Schweinfurt and
					over the nearby rural village of Sennfeld. The pilot gave the order to bail out before the
					plane disintegrated and crashed at Hausen, three miles east of Schweinfurt, Germany. {6 missions}.

					As it approached the city, the formation was swarmed by a large force of enemy

					The crew jettisoned bombs on a village as they were running low on fuel. The plane
					encountered intense flak and received some damage. On return and unable to find
					Bassingbourn in bad weather, the plane force landed at RAF Butley, Suffolk. Battle
					damaged during a mission to the port area at Wilhelmshaven, Germany 3Nov43.
					Moderate inaccurate flak was encountered over the target. Escort fighters were scheduled
					to cover the whole route over enemy territory but were not on hand for approximately
					ten minutes between the I.P. and the target, during which time the group was attacked
					by enemy fighters. The right horizontal stabiliser and elevator were damaged. Battle

					About twenty minutes from the target the bomber was attacked by enemy fighters,
					setting fire to No.3 engine. It was able to maintain formation but another attack set No.2
					engine on fire. The pilot rapidly dropped down to 15,000ft to shake off the fighters and
					turned back to home. Flak had damaged the bomb release and the crew was unable to
					jettison the bombs. A waist gunner eventually pried the bombs free one by one. For 500 miles
					the bomber hedge hopped over trees, roof tops and enemy pill boxes, spraying everything
					in sight with.50-caliber bullets, except when it passed over a prison camp at fifty feet and
					the captured men rushed into the yard to cheer and wave her on. Crossing the Belgian coast
					at low level, the flak batteries were lobbing artillery shells into the water to try and stop the
					plane. And while the plane limped along, the crew was praying that the two smoking
					engines wouldn't blow up. "We made a chapel out of that airplane today," said a gunner,
					after they finally reached their home base at Kimbolton. Failed to return from a mission to the
					port facilities and German airfield Chateau Bougon at Nantes, France 16Sep43 (1POW:9EVD).
					There was moderate and accurate flak from Rennes but at Nantes the flak was moderate and
					inaccurate. A large force of enemy fighters was encountered. Flying at 25,000ft, the bomber was
					under fighter attack from above and both sides while flying through heavy flak. A shell went
					through the fuel tank in the left wing which caught fire. The crew bailed out and the aircraft

					Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 31Dec43 (8KIA:2POW). The target was covered by smoke and cloud
					so the group diverted to the secondary target, a Luftwaffe airfield at Châteaubernard, Cognac, France.
					Intelligence reports indicated that very little opposition could be expected from this target, but
					unknown to the Americans, a Luftwaffe Flak unit had just completed their training at a gunnery
					school at St. Nazaire and were being transported to their new assignments. They, along with
					their guns, were on railway trucks close to the airfield, the gunners watching in amazement
					as the bombers headed towards them following the railway lines! Added to this was the fact
					that because of the supposed weak opposition expected, the bomber force had descended
					to a lower altitude to ensure pin-point accuracy with their bombing, thus presenting the
					Germans with a target they just could not fail to miss. The group headed over the target and
					immediately came under intense and deadly accurate anti-aircraft fire but continued to
					hold their course and releasing their bomb load. This plane escaped serious battle damage
					and left the target area with the main force. Several other aircraft had been badly hit and
					the formation broke up, with crippled bombers desperately trying to get away from the flak
					barrage. Having cleared the target area the bombers headed west, encountering some more flak
					from barges moored in the Gironde estuary, but then they were clear of the coast over the
					Bay of Biscay and on their way home. The formation was beginning its return flight across
					the Brest Peninsula and again came under attack, this time from German fighters.
					The loss of this bomber was specifically due to German fighters, one engine being lost
					and serious loss of power being incurred in another. During these attacks the tail gunner
					was fatally wounded and never regained consciousness. The pilot was forced to ditch
					the crippled aircraft twelve miles north of Guernsey, Channel Islands, the nine surviving
					crew members taking to the dinghies. Spirits rose in the belief that rescue would soon arrive;
					sadly this was not to be and, as the short winter daylight drew to a close, the crew in their
					saturated clothing huddled together for warmth against the bitter cold of the winter's night.
					By the early hours of the morning the dinghies were being carried towards the north-west corner
					of Guernsey where the dinghies were grounded on rocks. Ignored by German troops, who were
					prepared to leave them to their fate, the rising tide swept most of the crew away, only the
					bombardier and co-pilot surviving to be washed ashore by the surf where they were taken prisoner.

					Germany 11Jan44 (10KIA). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over
					English bases and a recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander
					of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division
					with greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided
					by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s
					were airborne to provide withdrawal support but they obeyed the recall order to return
					to England and left the bombers to fend for themselves on the return trip. It proved to
					be the most disastrous of the 303rd Bomb Group combat missions flown to date.
					The 303rd lost eleven of the forty B-17s flying the mission. Luftwaffe attacks started over

					the flak was moderate and inaccurate. A large force of enemy fighters was encountered.
					Two engines were disabled before the bomber reached the target. Later, the pilot dropped
					down to tree top level to fly back to England around the Brest peninsula. Battle damaged

					shipyard at Bremen, Germany 8Oct43. The formation was met with stiff resistance by German
					fighters and flak crews on the ground the entire way, from the Dutch coast all the way into the
					German heartland. In addition, a large force of German fighters launched vicious attacks
					against the planes. Over the target, the formation encountered intense flak. Battle damaged

					The tail gunner was wounded by a bullet during an attack by enemy fighters. Substantially battle
					damaged on a mission to the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft (Deschimag)
					shipyard at Bremen, Germany 8Oct43. The formation was met with stiff resistance by German
					fighters and flak crews on the ground the entire way, from the Dutch coast all the way into the
					German heartland. In addition, a large force of German fighters launched vicious attacks
					against the planes. Over the target, the formation encountered intense flak. A gunner was wounded by flak.
					Battle damaged on a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical works at Leverkusen, Germany 1Dec43.
					Clouds obscured the target so the formation diverted to the secondary target, a non-ferrous metals
					works at Solingen, Germany. The formation received some moderate flak over the Netherlands
					but it grew more intense as they approached the Ruhr Valley. The fighter escort reached the
					limit of their range and had to head for home. As soon as they left Luftwaffe came in to attack.
					On return, force landed with fuel exhaustion at RAF Manston, Kent. Battle damaged on a Crossbow
					mission to a German V-weapon site at Andres in the Pas-de-Calais, France 24Dec43. Flak over the
					target was heavy and accurate. Damaged in collision with parked B-17G 42-37736 while taxying at
					Bassingbourn 30Dec43. Failed to return from a mission to the Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac,
					Bordeaux, France 31Dec43 (2KIA:6POW:2EVD). The target was covered by smoke and cloud so
					the group diverted to the secondary target, a Luftwaffe airfield at Châteaubernard, Cognac, France.
					The flak burst directly above the right wing, A moment later, the number three engine froze and the
					pilot was unable to feather the propeller. Manifold pressure of the number four engine dropped
					sharply, an indication that the supercharger on that engine had been damaged as well.
					At full throttle, the plane couldn't maintain altitude and fell behind the formation. The pilot reversed
					course, turning northeast, out over the Bay of Biscay. There he opened the bomb bay doors and
					jettisoned the bombs harmlessly over the water. With greatly compromised engine thrust, the plane
					assumed a northerly course that would take it back to England. Progress was slowed by a strong
					headwind. It was estimated that it would take two hours to reach the Brest Peninsula. The plane was
					still gradually losing altitude but, on reaching the denser atmosphere at about 14,000ft, altitude
					stabilized. Soon afterward the temperature gauge on number one engine began to creep up.
					The pilot throttled back and began to lose altitude once again. Finally, the plane reached the
					Brest Peninsula, and was attacke by two Fw 190 fighters. Two or three cannon shells crashed
					through the right window exploding in the cockpit. The pilot was decapitated. The co-pilot tried
					to correct for a shallow dive to the right but the rudder was locked tight. He then instructed the
					crew to leave the plane. The plane crashed on a farm near Bannalec, forty miles northwest of Lorient, France.

					Named "Tondelayo". Named for the sexy character portrayed by Hedy Lamar in the movie 'White Cargo'..
					Battle damaged during a mission to the Gerhard Fieseler Werke (GFW) aircraft works at Waldau, Kassel,
					Germany 30Jul43. Struck by 20mm cannon shells, the aircraft returned safely to base. The ground crew
					collected eleven unexploded shells from the gas tanks, any one of which should have blown the bomber
					apart. The shells had been sent to the armorers to be defused but had then been rushed away by an
					intelligence officer. As the armourers opened each shell they didn't find an explosive charge; each
					shell was empty, harmless. Except one. Inside that one was a carefully rolled piece of paper with
					a note written in Czech by a laborer forced to make the shells for the Luftwaffe. The note said:
					"This is all we can do for you now". The crews' lives had been saved by someone they would
					never know; the worker would never know that he/she had saved ten lives. Failed to return from a
					mission to the Bosch magneto factory at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43. From the Initial Point until
					leaving the target area, there was a complete undercast except for small sparse patches of farm land.
					This group went over the target area twice without dropping their bombs. Bombs were finally dropped
					on Achern, a small town 18km southwest of Baden-Baden, Germany. Having spent too long over
					the target, the formation was beginning to realise that fuel exhaustion would likely lead to
					many not being able to return to base. Ditched in English Channel, crew rescued by ASR launch

					Failed to return from a mission to the harbor installations at Piraeus, Greece 11Jan44,
					collided with B-17F 42-3251, crashed Kalami, Greece. WEBFOOT
					On that fateful day, the briefed mission was for the 5th Wing composed of the 2nd, 97th,
					301st and 99th Bomb Groups, to fly on a southerly course through the heel of Italy to the town of
					Lecce where the Wing would then take a heading out over the Adriatic Sea, to a point over the
					Peloponnese peninsula of Greece. From this point the crews were briefed to complete a
					90° degree turn to the Initial Point over Lagousa Island. From there the mission dictated
					a straight run in to the target, reassemble, and return to base. After the formation was
					organized and began making its way to the target, the Groups ran into a weather front
					of 10/10 clouds. At eighteen thousand feet they entered an overcast. The clouds were very
					thick and visibility was not much beyond the wingtips, making it almost impossible to
					see other aircraft in the formation. At that altitude, and with the thickness of the clouds,
					ice began to form on their wings. In such situations it was standard operating procedure
					for trailing squadrons in the formation to fly off course for a couple minutes to obtain
					some spacing from the lead squadron, which would continue to maintain its course.
					However, as the 97th Bomb Group began making a left turn for their bomb run on the target,
					the lead plane of the 342nd Bomb Squadron encountered severe turbulence made by the
					preceding elements of the Wing. The turbulence was so severe that the lead aircraft of the
					squadron was forced into a steep left bank before it plummeted temporarily out of control
					and lost altitude at a rate of 1,000ft per minute. By the time the pilot was able to recover
					and regain his place in formation, the two sister planes in the flight were nowhere to be seen.
					Meanwhile, the pilots of the two sister planes from the flight, B-17F 42-3251 and B-17F 42-29918
					found themselves alone in 10/10 visibility, unsure where the formation had disappeared to,
					with ice forming on their wings, and experiencing engine trouble. From what was deduced
					later in the accident report, the doomed B-17s made the decision to abort and turn back for
					the relative safety of Italy. In a tragic turn of events, their decision to return home took them
					directly into the path of the oncoming 301st Bomb Group. According to the official report of the
					Board of Inquiry, the two B-17s of the 97th Bomb Group experienced engine trouble and left the
					formation. Instead of making a 180-degree right turn, away from the formation, the aircraft
					made a turn to the left and flew head-on into the 301st formation. According to a Bombardier
					assigned to the lead ship of the 301st Bomb Group, and flown by the Group Commanding Officer,
					he was startled to see a pair of 97th Bomb Group B-17s emerge out of a cloud about 20 degrees
					to the left and aimed straight at his aircraft. Almost Instantly, both B-17s bracketed his aircraft,
					with one passing closely over his right wing that clipped the vertical stabiliser, and the other
					closely passing beneath the left wing. Almost immediately, the tail gunner witnessed a big ball
					of fire that lit up the clouds as the B-17s collided with one fortress in the lead element, and
					two B-17s in the second element. P-38 pilots, flying low cover escort under the overcast,
					reported watching pieces of B-17s raining from the sky for what seemed like five minutes.
					There were eight B-17s that fell out of the sky simultaneously. Thirteen Americans survived;
					64 perished MACR 9439

					approached the initial point (I.P.) of the bomb run, it encountered heavy flak.
					Enemy fighter opposition was very aggressive. A 20mm cannon shell exploded
					between the waist gunners killing them and severed the oxygen lines feeding the
					rear of the aircraft. The ball turret gunner had also been killed, Since the surviving
					gunners could not survive without oxygen and the bail out bottles would not last
					long enough to complete the mission, the pilot immediately left the formation
					and with maximum throttle headed down and set a return course for England.

					three of them attacked the bomber continually down to about 6,000ft when
					there was a heavy 'thump' and the pilots immediately encountered a frozen

					Failed to return from a mission to Nantes, France 4Jul43 (10POW). Damaged by flak,
					the No.1 engine was damaged, which forced the pilot to change course. The aircraft
					was pursued by three Fw 190 fighters, which damaged two more engines, first No.2,
					then No.3 propeller oversped and No.4 engine was running rough. Unable to maintain
					altitude with only one engine, the pilot saw an unobstructed beach at low tide on the
					island of Noirmoutier. He decided to try a crash landing. The pilot managed to land the
					aircraft in 1.5m of water. The 10 crew were extracted from the cabin, under the fire of
					German ground troops who witnessed the crash. The crew were helped by local fishermen,
					 braving enemy fire, giving them a sail to carry one who could not walk. The 10 crew were
					captured alive, and the B-17 was abandoned to the Germans who took advantage of the
					opportunity to inspect a B-17 which was almost complete. Named BATTLING BASTARDS.
					Today there is much left of the carcass of the B-17. It is visible in certain tidal conditions,

					fighters. A rocket hit the bomb rack; the ball turret gunner was killed by fire and fragments
					upon impact of the rocket. The plane was set afire and getting out of control as the pilot
					drops out of the formation. He ordered the crew to bail out immediately while he tried to
					keep the plane in the air as long as possible. Three airmen land near the small Belgian
					border town of Eisden, east of Hasselt. The left wing broke away south of Sittard and the
					aircraft exploded, killing the radio operator and blowing out three more airmen landing
					in the city of Geleen, south of Sittard. In the explosion, the bombs were tossed out of the
					plane and landed between Geleen and Beek. The farm house of the Stassen family was
					hit by one of these bombs, which pierced through the roof and the floors, but did not explode.
					Fortunately, the other bombs caused little or no damage. The plane wreckage crashed

					found trapped in No.3 engine. Incident during a mission to the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt,
					Germany 14Oct43. En route to the target area, the bomber formation was repeatedly attacked by a
					large number of Luftwaffe fighters. After the target, the Group turned and headed westward for England.
					German fighters, having landed and refueled, attacked again until, finally, the bombers reached
					the coastline of western Europe and relative safety. The pilots and top-turret gunners, as well as
					several crewmen in the Plexiglas noses of the bombers, reported a cluster of discs in the path
					of the 384th Bomb Group's formation. The discs in the cluster were agreed upon as being silver-colored,
					about one inch thick and three inches in diameter. #026 closed rapidly with a cluster of discs.
					The pilot jinked the aircraft violently, attempting to evade an imminent collision with the discs.
					The pilot reported at the intelligence debriefing that the right wing went directly through a cluster
					with absolutely no effect on engines or plane surface. He stated further that one of the discs was
					heard to strike the tail assembly of the airplane. Neither the pilot, nor any member of the crew that
					heard the disc striking the tail, felt or witnessed an explosion of any kind. The pilot explained further
					that about twenty feet from the discs a report confirmed by other pilots and crew members
					they watched a mass of black debris of varying sizes, in clusters of three by four feet, floating past their
					aircraft. It is recorded in the official histories of the Air Force "as one of the most baffling incidents
					of World War II, and an enigma that to this day defies all explanation". Participated in practice
					'Grapefruit' missions to drop practice GB-1 glide bombs over the Isle of Man 7-15Nov43.
