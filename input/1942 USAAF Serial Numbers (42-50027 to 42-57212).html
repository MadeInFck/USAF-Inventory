					Failed to return from a mission to a tank factory at Moravská Ostrava a P?ívoz, Czechoslovakia 29Aug44 (1KIA:9POW).
					The Liberator was lagging and lost sight of the formation because of failure of the No.2 engine.
					The pilot joined the 20th Bomb Squadron, 2nd Bomb Group B-17 Fortress formation which was in the tail end charlie
					position. It was a disastrous day for the 2nd Bomb Group, losing nine B-17s in a onesided, nineteen-minute attack
					by the Luftwaffe on the way to the target; unfortunately the 20th Bomb Squadron lost all seven of its aircraft to enemy fighters.
					The Liberator was the last aircraft of the formation at the time of the German attack. However, the German fighters did not attack it;
					apparently they considered it already doomed. Just before reaching I.P., engine no.2 caught fire and the pilot tried to feather the
					propeller. This was followed by jettisoning the bombs over the Váh river near the village of Zamarovce. The fire advanced to
					the wing fuel tanks and the crew bailed out; the ball turret gunner was believed to have been trapped, possibly by
					centrifugal force, and his body was found in the wreckage. The bomber crashed in a forest near Sidonie, Czechoslovakia. ROUGH COBB.

					glider was transporting men from the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division
					to a landing zone at Eindhoven, The Netherlands during Operation Market. Bad weather seriously
					disrupted the missions flown that day. The second serial, consisting of 40 CG4A gliders and
					their tug aircraft, had to abandon the mission and return to base. The aircraft had been flying
					through a solid bank of cloud and for most of the journey the glider pilots were unable to see
					their tow planes. The call to return was received by the formation midway across the English Channel.
					As the aircraft and glider combinations returned to Membury so the gliders would, one by one,
					break from their tow planes and manoeuvre into position, before landing on the grass infield
					of the aerodrome. It was during this part of the aborted mission that two gliders from the
					82nd Troop Carrier Squadron collided. Both aircraft were on their downwind leg when they
					tragically came together, falling into a field close to Membury's base hospital.
