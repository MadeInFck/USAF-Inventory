					Crashed without a pilot at Blythe AAB, CA 16Dec42. The C-53 42-47379 took off from
					South Plains Army Air Field towing the Waco CG-4A glider being ferried to Victorville Army
					Flying School at Victorville, California. The flight plan included an overnight stop at
					Tucson, Arizona. In addition to the flight crew the aircraft also carried four passengers.
					It was almost dark when the tow plane/glider combination arrived over Blythe Army Air Field,
					California, 150 miles south of Victorville. Suddenly, the glider pilot saw a light
					blinking in the astrodome of the C-53, the normal night signal for the pilot to release the
					glider. Believing they were over Tucson, their planned overnight stop, the pilot released his
					glider and landed. Once on the ground he began staking down the glider and adding chocks to
					the ailerons, elevators and rudder. Just as he completed preparing the glider for an
					overnight stay the tower notified him that the C-53 pilot had radioed that the glider had
					landed at the wrong base. The tower operator added that the C-53 was landing to retrieve
					the glider. The C-53 copilot had erroneously given the cutoff signal. After the tow plane
					landed it took some time for base personnel to locate the tow rope in the fading light.
					The glider pilot tried to convince the tow pilot to remain overnight but he refused.
					Eye-witnesses indicated that the tow pilot appeared to be anxious to get underway.
					He taxied the C-53 to a point adjacent to the east end of the east-west runway and stopped.
					The glider copilot took a flashlight and motioned the tow plane into position on the runway.
					Then the glider was towed into position behind the tow plane. When the glider was in position
					the tow rope was hooked to the C-53 while the glider pilot hooked it to the CG-4A,
					one of many mistakes; the tow rope was not to be hooked to the glider until both pilots were
					in their seats with their safety belts fastened. The glider pilot instructed an aircraft
					mechanic from the base to get the flashlight and stand by the left wingtip of the tow plane
					so he could signal the tow pilot to take up the slack in the tow rope.
					Just before entering the glider the pilot noticed that the chocks had not been removed from the
					ailerons, elevators and rudder. He instructed his copilot to remove the chocks from the
					right aileron while he removed them from the elevators and rudder. He started for the
					left aileron when suddenly the glider began moving forward. The tow pilot had interpreted
					the half-moon signal given to take up the tow rope slack as the signal to take off.
					As the glider moved forward the glider pilot ran for the door of the glider but never made it;
					the glider was moving too fast. Before he and his copilot could get out of the way,
					the rear elevator struck them and knocked them down. The tow plane took off and made a 270
					degree turn to the right, flew south a short distance, turned left and then made a 360 degree
					turn to the right. At this point the tow plane was over the south edge of the field at
					approximately 400 feet when the pilot released the glider. The aircraft accident report
					indicated that the pilotless glider collided with the tow plane damaging the left horizontal
					stabilizer causing the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. The C-53 stalled and
					crashed almost immediately followed by the glider a short distance away [8KIS].

					aircraft of the 15th Air Force (B-24 Liberator) and 416th Night Fighting Squadron (Bristol Beaufigher).
					This airfield is now an active airport and is called Taranto-Grottaglie "Marcello Arlotta" Airport.
					Pilot Platoon-leader Zygmunt Du?ski reported that there was a total lack of visibility and the crew
					was planning to increase the ceiling and jump with parachutes. The rain was freezing, the airplane
					was iced and climbed up with difficulty. All heavy cargo of armament in drop containers (not dropped
					in Poland) was still on board. Soon after this report there was a disaster. The Liberator GR-T,
					at 05:10, suddenly fell down in the centre of city Villa Castelli, on the main street leading to
					the market square and the town hall. The airplane entered a storey building at 142 Vittorio
					Emanuele Street, 5 people died in the ruins of the building, the entire Italian family of many
					generations. One person was injured. The fall of the plane fell at a large angle, as only one
					building was destroyed in the compact development of the city centre and the adjacent buildings
					suffered minor damage. One of the engines of the bomber was found several hundred meters away,
					on the neighbouring street. All the airmen were killed. A fire broke out, which was quickly extinguished.

					Aircraft’s own MSN system uses Fx123 which is similar to
					RAF serials and may be the source of comments relating to the MSN being the RAF serial.

					Groupe de Reconnaissance GR II/33 within the 3rd Photo Group.
					Part of the wreckage was found in 70 meters of water March/April 2004.
					The German pilot who (most probably) shot down St-Ex, was Horst Rippert who confirmed to be the
					responsible person, he acknowledged having shot down a Lightning at this time / date and location,
					partially supported by reports of a German radar station close to Lyon.
					It can't be said with guaranty that the story was as described.
 					Tentatively reported that some of the recovered
					parts were those from a Bf 109, indicating that a midair collision might have taken place
					But this BF 109 was flown by Alexis zu Bentheim und Steinfurt, a German
					nobleman (Prince to be accurate), he was killed in action on Dec 2nd 1943. So it is a coincidence
					that both wrecks were found in the same area.

					the planes had left Catania, they came into snow storms. The radio operator onboard of this C-53 could not
					make radio contact with the control tower at Bari. The crew decided that they were lost. There was no trace of
					the other two planes. After some four hours flying, the weather c1eared. The pilot discovered an airfield and
					prepared for a landing. Suddenly the plane was fired upon and the pilot had to make a forced landing with
					wheels up in a muddy field. When the plane came to a halt, armed men surrounded it; these men were
					partisans and it turned out that the plane had landed in Albania. Luckily the partisans were pro-American.
					The men were in a hurry and took the Americans to a safe place. They traveled from village to village and,
					together with the partisans, Christmas was celebrated. They all moved on 27Dec43. Soon the Germans were
					after the group and they were fired upon. The group could get away, but became separated; three nurses
					stayed behind. In the meantime the partisans had contacted the allies and British commandos were
					dropped near the group to assist them. The entire group moved in the direction of the coast, where a boat of the
					Royal Navy waited for them. The group arrived in Italy on 9Jan44; the three nurses who had been separated
					from the group were smuggled to Italy by the partisans and arrived in Italy Mar44.

				68939 Bell Aircraft Corporation, Wheatfield, NY. Crashed after the pilot bailed out when he was
					unable to recover from a flat spin 3.5 miles north of Niagara Falls Municipal Airport, NY 29Apr44.
					The Russians were in Buffalo testing the P-63A and reviewing the modifications made to eliminate
					issues found with the P-39 Airacobra. An excessive aft center of gravity with the P-39 would,
					under certain loading conditions, induce a spin which would develop into a more serious flat spin.
					Another problem had been insufficient rigidity with the rear fuselage. Not convinced that American
					designers had fully solved these issues, Colonel Kochetkov took a new aircraft for a test flight.
					Having entered a flat spin, he was unable to recover and, at 900 meters, jettisoned the door
					and bailed out. Bell management recognised that they needed to enhance the anti-spin
					performance and took the Colonel to a restaurant to celebrate
