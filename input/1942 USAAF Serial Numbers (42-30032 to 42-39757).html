					Named *Pasaden Nena/Torchy*--Named after the wife of the first
					navigator because of her red hair.    Failed to return from a mission to the Caudron-Renault
					factory at Paris, France 3Sep43 (1KIA:2POW:7EVD). When the formation reached Paris,
					the target was obscured by clouds so diverted to an alternate target, the Luftwaffe
					airfield at Beaumont Le Roger near Paris. En route to the target, halfway between
					Paris and Chartres, the plane was hit by flak. No.1 engine went out completely and the
					bomber dropped behind the formation. Flak or an incendiary shell started a fire
					between No.1 and No.2 engines. Two Bf 109 fighters made one pass when the engineer
					reported a fire then the whole bottom was shot out of the pilots cabin. The crew bailed
					out before the aircraft crashed; the tail gunner was killed when he became entangled
				 	in the tail wreckage as the plane disintegrated before it crashed at Cerny, Essonne, France
				30036 (MSN 5150) Accepted by USAAF 28Mar43. United Air Lines, Modification Center #10,
					Cheyenne Municipal Airport, WY 2Apr43. 384th Bomb Group, Sioux City AAB, IA 13Apr43.
					Departed to Kearney Field, NB for overseas processing 3May43. Staging Base,
					21st Bomb Wing, Kearney Field, NB. Departed late May43 en route to Grafton Underwood,

					Bangor, ME 30May43. 546th Bomb Squadron, 384th Bomb Group, Grafton Underwood
					(Station 106), Northamptonshire 8Jun43. The aircraft was involved in a mid-air collision
					with B-17F 42-30131 during a practice flight 12Jun43 (5KIS). They were two of sixteen
					bombers which were landing out of their formation on return to base at Grafton Underwood.
					Initial confusion on the correct landing runway had been resolved but had caused these
					two aircraft to go-around for another attempt because of poor spacing. 42-30036 is
					believed to have bounced during its first attempt to land and was going around the pattern
					at a lower level than 42-30131 which was now above it on base leg by about 1,000ft.
					They both turned final about the same time without the pilots seeing the other aircraft.
					The control tower was showing a red light to 42-30131 but this was not observed by the
					crew. A call from the tower to 'pull up' was misheard and both aircraft pulled up about
					the same time. The tail of 42-30036 hit the nose and then No.2 engine of the upper aircraft.
					Momentarily locked together, the propeller sliced through the tail of this aircraft, cutting off
					the vertical stabiliser a few feet forward of the fin. This bomber reared straight up,
					fell off on its left wing and headed nose down for the ground where it exploded in flames
					on impact. {nil missions}. Salvaged 12Jun43
				30037 (MSN 5151) Accepted by USAAF 28Mar43. United Air Lines, Modification Center #10,
					Cheyenne Municipal Airport, WY 2Apr43. Combat Crew Training School, Casper Field, WY 4Apr43.
					384th Bomb Group, Sioux City AAB, IA 13Apr43. Departed to Kearney Field, NB for overseas
					processing 3May43. Staging Base, 21st Bomb Wing, Kearney Field, NB. Departed late May43

					384th Bomb Group, Grafton Underwood (Station 106), Northamptonshire 29May43.
					{first combat mission 26Jun43}. Failed to return from a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield
					at Villacoublay, France 26Jun43 (10POW). When the plane crossed the French coast it was
					struck by flak between the No.3 engine and its firewall. The propeller was lost and the engine
					caught fire. The pilot dove the plane in an effort to put the fire out and then leveled out.
					This maneuver didn't work and No.3 engine fell off the wing. Control of No.4 engine was lost,
					probably caused by an attack by enemy fighters. The crew was ordered to bail out and
					six crew members jumped out of the plane. A Bf 109 pulled up on the right wing tip.
					The pilot had landing gear and flaps down in an effort to slow his fighter enough to stay
					next to the slowing bomber. At this point, the bombardier woke up; he had probably been
					hit by No.3 propeller when it spun off and hit the fuselage. Seeing the German fighter, he began
					to fire at it and caused it to fall away. The German fighters then renewed their attacks.
					The bomber suffered through several head-on attacks. One of these shot out the windscreen
					on the left side and the pilot was hit very badly. Shot down by Ltn Fritz Karch of II./JG2 flying
					a Bf 109G-6. The plane crash landed at Saint-Gatien-des-Bois airfield, Deauville, France.
					The forward fuselage was destroyed by fire during the crash. {1 mission}
					Pieces of this aircraft were displayed in a
					museum established at Paris-Nanterre by occupying German forces.

					on which it had flown and never dropped a bomb on a target prior to this mission.
					Failed to return from a shuttle mission to the Messerschmitt aircraft factories at
					Regensburg, Germany 17Aug43 (10POW). The aircraft lost one engine just after
					crossing the enemy coast early in mission and a second at the target. Realizing
					they probably could not reach Africa but at no time did they consider Switzerland.
					Had one bomb hang up over target and tried to release it over a small airfield
					 near the Brenner Pass but it wouldn't go. Later released it manually over the
					Mediterranean. Dropped to 500ft and threw out everything not nailed down.
					Just north of Naples the aircraft turned for Sicily because at briefing had been
					told Sicily would fall that day. About 90 miles from Sicily the aircraft lost a third engine.
					The pilot shut down the remaining engine and ditched. The aircraft floated for about
					an hour and a half. The crew were picked up next morning by Germans in a flying boat.
					MACR 682.  10 POW
				30043 (MSN 5157) Accepted by USAAF 29Mar43. United Air Lines, Modification Center #10,
					Cheyenne Municipal Airport, WY 3Apr43. 384th Bomb Group, Sioux City AAB, IA 14Apr43.
					Departed to Kearney Field, NB for overseas processing 3May43. Staging Base,
					21st Bomb Wing, Kearney Field, NB. Departed late May43 en route to Grafton Underwood,
					England via North Atlantic route. North Atlantic Wing, Air Transport Command,
					Dow Field, Bangor, ME 23May43. 547th Bomb Squadron [SO*V], 384th Bomb Group,
					Grafton Underwood (Station 106), Northamptonshire 29May43.  Named *Ruthless*
					{first combat mission 22Jun43}. Fitted with Gee-H radio navigation system equipment.
					Battle damaged on a mission to a roller bearing factory at Stuttgart, Germany 6Sep43.
					From the Initial Point until leaving the target area, there was a complete undercast
					except for small sparse patches of farm land. This group went over the target area twice
					without dropping their bombs. Bombs were finally dropped on Achern, a small town 18km
					southwest of Baden-Baden, Germany. Having spent too long over the target, the formation
					was beginning to realise that fuel exhaustion would likely lead to many not being
					able to return to base. Force landed at RAF West Malling, Kent (10RTD). Failed to return
					from a mission to industrial areas at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 4Oct43 (10RTD).
					The pilot took the plane up for a test spin, it had just had its engines overhauled and only
					had about ten flight hours on them. When he returned the pilot decided that they were
					not going to have enough fuel for the mission. The pilot saw the ground crew chief
					passing by and asked for more fuel for the plane. At first the chief said "Can't, you know
					everyone gets an allotment of 3000 gallons". The pilot pleaded with the crew chief to give
					them a break and the chief relented. The chief sent the ground crew to the wing to start
					filling the tanks. As the ground crew began hooking up to the wing tanks a young engineering
					Lieutenant came riding by on a bicycle. He stopped and asked them why they were getting fuel.
					The pilot told him that he wanted a little extra so that they can get back home. The young
					engineering lieutenant officiously said, "You know what the orders are" and he waved the
					ground crew off the plane. In those precious few minutes the ground crew probably only
					put in an extra 50-60 gallons of gasoline before they disconnected. A B-17 burned fifty gallons
					or more an hour for each engine or approximately 200 gallons per hour. 'Ruthless' got an extra
					fifteeen minutes. With only a little extra fuel in their wing tanks the crew of 'Ruthless' took
					off for the raid on Frankfurt. After the plane made it to the target and dropped its bombs
					the pilot cut out the two outboard engines to conserve fuel and were going to go home
					on the two inboard engines. The pilot tried as best as he could to keep up with the squadron
					but with flying on only two engines the plane was soon lagging behind. As it limped back
					home it was again flying over Belgium. The pilot had given the order to get rid of everything
					that was not nailed down. The crew threw out everything, jackets, boots, rags, plane parts,
					anything to make the plane lighter to conserve fuel. By that time the crew happened to see
					five or six Spitfires flying alongside of them; they must have realised that the bomber
					was in trouble. The bomber continued to putter on home, the crew feeling a little better with
					having an escort to protect them. They flew over the North Sea to where the English Channel
					meets. The co-pilot wanted the pilot to go up over the white cliffs of Dover, but the fuel was
					almost gone and they were losing altitude, therefore there was no chance of clearing the cliffs.
					The pilot battled to keep the bomber airborne; with resignation, he told everyone to take their
					ditching positions. The aft crew went up to the radio room and took their positions. Then they
					heard a hissing sound as the tail of the B-17 started to drag on top of the water. The plane hit
					the water hard. The life rafts had deployed and were tethered to the side of the plane by the wing.
					The Spitfires continued to circle in the air to guard the men in the life rafts. A short distance
					away an English trawler HM Drifter (the English used it for a radar picket boat) was coming
					toward them. They were coming to pick them up. The sailors got the crew on board and below
					deck. The picket boat could not leave its station to return the crew to land so it radioed for
					another boat. The Royal Air Force sent out a 40-foot motorboat 'Lord Keith' made out of mahogany.
					The next morning the crew was flown back to Grafton Underwood in a Douglas C-47. {18 missions}.

					the formation was swarmed by a large force of enemy aircraft for an estimated forty-five minutes
					of vicious fighting. By the time their friendly fighter escorts arrived to drive off the Luftwaffe,
					the damage had already been done. One Bf 109 collided with B-17F 42-30723. The collision
					occurred on the aircraft's left wing with flames erupting throughout the plane. The plane exploded
					in mid-air after going into a steep spiral. It has been speculated that "Sweater Girl" also was
					damaged by this mid-air collision but surviving crew members report that the aircraft was under
					heavy flak followed by fighter attacks and was severly damaged before the crew was ordered
					to bail out. There is no mention from crew reports that their plane sustained any damage from

					was repeatedly attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters. Damaged by flak after bombing
					the target, two engine superchargers were struck, part of the oxygen system was destroyed
					and two gunners were seriously wounded. The No.3 fuel tank was holed and the engineer
					successfully manipulated the fuel transfer system to retain sufficient fuel to return safely
					to Great Ashfield. Failed to return from a mission to the industrial area of Solingen,
					 Germany 30Nov43 (4KIA:6RTD). The crew was tasked as the lead of the low squadron.
					After climbing through a thick cloud layer and breaking out on top at about 19,000ft,
					the pilot directed the engineer to fire a red flare as a signal for the rest of the squadron
					to form up on them. The M8 flare exploded igniting the gun kit box causing a secondary
					explosion. With the entire top turret in flames, a full load of fused 500 pound bombs
					and bundles of incendiary bombs, the pilot immediately ordered the crew to bail out.
					The plane crashed and exploded coming to rest in a field 1/2 mile west of Penlan Hall,

					Escort fighters were scheduled to cover the whole route over enemy territory but were not on hand
					for approximately ten minutes between the I.P. and the target, during which time the group was
					attacked by enemy fighters. The bomber was attacked by a Bf 109 fighter which disabled No.2 engine.
					The pilot headed for the cover of contrails and returned safely to Rougham. The crew chief
					found a 0.50 caliber bullet in the inverter beneath the co-pilot's seat, the result of 'friendly fire'.
					Failed to return from a mission to the Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux,
					France 5Jan44 (8KIA:2EVD). The bomber was set upon by enemy fighters about 5km west of
					Saint-Laurent-Médoc, France. Immediately after the first fighter attack one propeller had to
					be feathered and the tail controls were damaged. The tail Gunner was badly wounded and
					then the radio system failed. The engineer/top turret gunner went to the rear of the plane to
					inform the other gunners of the bail out instructions from the pilot. As he was passing through
					the bomb bay the aircraft went into a crash dive. The ball turret gunner was trapped in the
					ball turret. The co-pilot was injured and assisted the pilot on an attempt to maintain control
					of the aircraft so that the crew could bail out. The two pilots were to set-up the AFCE
					(Automatic Flight Control Equipment) and attempt to return to England. The pilot was
					then injured by the explosion of a cannon shell; the main portion of the cannon blast was in
					the area of the pilot and co-pilots seats. As the bombardier and navigator were bailing out,
					the plane went into a vertical dive with the right wing in flames and breaking off.
					Shot down by an enemy Ju 88 fighter of 3./ ZG 1 which knocked off the tail. Exploded and

					Retained the 95th Bomb Group [B] tail symbol. Flown on a mission to Ghent, Belgium 6Jan45 (1INJ:9RTD).
					The crew was instructed to take off prior to the main force of planes. The weather over England
					was extremely bad as the crew headed for their destination over Ghent, Belgium. The plane cleared
					the overcast and ascended to its assigned 27,000ft altitude. The weather worsened and word
					 came over the radio that the mission had been scrubbed and they were to return to base;
					the other planes never took off. The plane was heading for home when suddenly, and without
					warning, all their navigational aids stopped functioning; Gee box, compass, radio,
					all communication devices gone. The crew was hopelessly lost. With no way of knowing exactly
					where they were, they headed west, by the sun, dropping down until they sighted land at 500 feet.
					They started following the coastline and soon spotted what they thought were some Channel Islands
					that were still in German hands. As the plane circled, looking for a place to land, it encountered a
					heavy barrage of anti-aircraft fire that promptly knocked out the No.2 engine. The propeller was
					feathered and the plane left the hostile area. After flying for two hours, the crew jettisoned
					everything, not tied down, in an attempt to preserve their diminishing fuel supply. They
					sighted a Douglas C-47 and followed it for a while, hoping to find land, but soon gave
					up thinking they might be headed out into the North Sea where they had been told of a
					crew ditching and freezing to death in thirty minutes. The crew considered going back to the
					island and try to land knowing that they would become prisoners of war. Although desperate,
					no one thought this to be a good idea. Darkness was closing in fast and with only about an
					hour and a half of fuel supply left they spotted a convoy of ships in the English Channel.
					The crew now had two options; they could ditch near one of the ships in the convoy,
					hoping to survive the ditching and be picked up by one of the ships or they could continue
					flying hoping to spot a place to land before their fast dwindling fuel supply ran out.
					The crew unanimously agreed to ditch. They signaled to the convoy that they were coming
					in but could not make out the reply. The crew assumed their ditching positions as the pilot
					smoothly set the Fortress down in the English Channel southwest of Guernsey, Channel Islands.
					Water came gushing into the radio room as the crew successfully exited the ditched plane
					only to find that both dinghies were stuck in their compartments and would not eject automatically.
					After manually pulling them free, they inflated and the crew climbed in, successfully, and
					began paddling a safe distance from the plane toward one of the ships in the convoy.
					They cleared the plane in about forty seconds before it sank. A lifeboat was sent out
					from one of the ships to pick them up. At this point, the crew did not know if the ship crews
					were British or German as they all wore black turtleneck sweaters. With their 45's at the
					ready their fears were soon alleviated upon leaming that the rescuers were British. As they were
					being pulled aboard the Royal Navy trawler HMS Gweal, a pool of blood was noticed in one of the
					dinghies and upon further investigation it was found that the toggalier was bleeding profusely
					a nasty cut on his hand, the only casualty from the long ordeal. The crew was taken to Plymouth,
					arriving the following morning and later flown back to Mendlesham. Salvaged 6Jan45

					In the middle of the reversal maneuver, about thirty German Bf 109G-6 fighters of JG 3/8 attacked
					and pursued them southwards. Without realizing it, the Americans flew over Switzerland near

					Bad Ragaz was on alert and observed the approach of the formation. At that time, the Swiss
					anti-aircraft defense had the task of shooting at foreign formations of more than three aircraft.
					While overflying their position, this aircraft was targeted and brought down with a direct hit over

					were landing out of their formation on return to base at Grafton Underwood. Initial confusion
					on the correct landing runway had been resolved but had caused these two aircraft to go-around
					for another attempt because of poor spacing. 42-30036 is believed to have bounced during
					its first attempt to land and was going around the pattern at a lower level than 42-30131
					which was now above it on base leg by about 1,000ft. They both turned final about the same time
					without the pilots seeing the other aircraft. The control tower was showing a red light
					to 42-30131 but this was not observed by the crew. A call from the tower to 'pull up' was
					misheard and both aircraft pulled up about the same time. The tail of 42-30036 hit the nose a

					hold formation under and around these storms. It was rough flying just above the white caps.
					The squadron was burning too much of the fuel they would be needing for the trip home.
					Before the target. the squadron was attacked by enemy fighters. As the squadron left the
					target after the bomb drop, it encountered an overcast above 20,000ft over the coastal area.
					Formation was abandoned and It was every one on his own. The bombers fanned out and
					began to descend. It was necessary to keep a close watch on dead reckoning or time and
					distance while trying to keep a steady speed and heading. With fuel exhaustion, the plane
					ditched off Cape Comino, Sardinia. Crew rescued and returned to base two days later.

					The bomber had been badly hit by enemy fighters en route to Schweinfurt. Most of the bomb
					doors had been blown away and the oxygen system so badly damaged that some of the crew
					members started to pass out. The pilot remained with the group long enough to bomb,
					then peeled off and dived hard, still under fighter attack, down to tree-top level where the crew
					could breathe more easily. With the main force returning to England by a northerly route,
					the pilot hoped to stay out of trouble by taking a southerly route. The aircraft was then
					attacked by a Dornier 217 from the night fighter training unit NJG 101 which followed it for
					about 30 minutes doing damage to the wings. The bomber passed directly over Sandhofen
					airfield on the outskirts of Mannheim, shooting up the airfield as it passed. Both tail guns
					burnt out and the top turret was hit and jammed. The pilot was injured but the main problem
					was now a big hole blown in a fuel tank. From earlier damage, the fuel transfer system was
					inoperative. The Dornier was chased off by the ball turret gunner but the chances of the crew
					reaching England were now slim. They were offered a chance to head for Switzerland but
					declined, hoping to at least reach the coast, confident in their chances of rescue by RAF
					Air-Sea Rescue launches. The aircraft flew on for another 180 miles before the fuel was
					exhausted. The aircraft was crash landed in a field between Sissonne and Montcornet,
					about twenty miles north of Reims, France where the crew attempted to set fire to and
					destroy their aircraft but the incendiary bombs failed to work. {2 missions}.

					a mission to the port area at Kiel, Germany 13Dec43 (4KIA:6INJ). Heavy frosting and poor
					visiblity frustrated the attack and the group diverted to Hamburg where the plane suffered battle
					damage. Both engines on the left wing had been disabled and the propellers feathered
					causing the plane to fall back out of formation. A third engine failed as the bomber started
					back over the North Sea. The crew jettisoned unneceesary equipment to lessen the weight
					and reduce the rate of descent. Below the clouds and close to the waves, the failed third engine
					picked up and produced some power. This enabled the pilots to regain some altitude and
					held steady at 300 feet until reaching the sandy shores of Norfolk. The pilot elected to try
					for a landing at Snetterton Heath and joined the circuit with other returning bombers.
					On final approach, the pilot may have had to manoeuvre to avoid another plane because
					the plane suddenly reared up, stalled and dove into the ground. An engine was torn off and
					bounced into the radio room hatch, killing three airmen. The forward section finished upside
					down facing towards the torn off tail. The bomber crashed on the A11 road adjacent to the
					airfield at Snetterton Heath. Salvaged 15Dec43. .

					Force base at Bône, Algeria. Later positioned to Telergma, Algeria. On return to England, operated a
					mission to a Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 24Aug43 (2WIA:10RTD). Colonel David,
					Commander of the 388th Bomb Group, was in the co-pilot's seat as Command Pilot of the formation.
					The Group had finished bombing the Luftwaffe airfield near Bordeaux and were headed home over the
					Bay of Biscay. Enemy fighters made a furious attack. Colonel David saw a German fighter peel off to
					the right and gasoline pouring from a right wing tank; the Fortress had been hit by 20mm cannon shells.
					At almost the same instant bullets slashed into the cockpit from a head-on attack, one of them wounding
					the pilot in the leg, others destroying the hydraulic system and an oxygen tank. Colonel David found
					himself in a sea of flames that burned his hair, face and hands, and shriveled his flying jacket. For some
					seconds the plane flew wild then he put the plane into a dive to get down close to the water so he
					could ditch the aircraft; it was too far off shore to have any chance if the crew bailed out at altitude.
					While the plane dropped from 21,000ft down to 10,000ft, the fire burned itself out and the bomber was
					pulled out of its dive. The wings stayed on, the plane flew level and the leaking gasoline tank did not
					explode. Enemy fighters returned to the attack, aiming their tracers at the flood of gasoline streaming
					from the bomber's wing. Colonel David, alone in the cockpit, flew evasive action. In a twenty minute
					battle, the gunners knocked down four of the German planes and drove off the rest. The wounded
					engineer succeeded in transferring gasoline out of the damaged tank and the torrent of escaping fuel
					stopped. It was Colonel David in the pilot's seat and the bombardier in the co-pilot's place who
					brought the plane to a safe landing at Knettishall. Battle damaged on an Operation Starkey mission
					to the industrial area of Paris, France 9Sep43 (1WIA:9RTD). The briefed route was followed to the I.P.
					when the lead bombardier was hit by flak and unable to complete the bomb run on the primary target.
					There was cloud cover over the secondary target which was the Luftwaffe airfield at Beaumont Sur Oise,
					northwest of Paris. The bombardier was wounded by flak. Major battle damage on a mission to the ball
					bearing factories at Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43. En route to the target area, the bomber formation
					was repeatedly attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe fighters. After the target, the Group turned and
					headed westward for England. German fighters, having landed and refueled, attacked again until, finally,
					the bombers reached the coastline of western Europe and relative safety. Battle damaged on a Crossbow
					mission to a German V-weapon site on the Cherbourg peninsula, France 26Mar44 (1WIA:9RTD). Flak over
					the city of Cherbourg was intense, the ball turret gunner was wounded by flak. Failed to return from a
					mission to a Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 27Mar44 (5KIA:3POW:2EVD). A flare
					set off a fire in the radio room just before reaching the target. The bomber left the formation, circled,
					and finally went into a steep dive. Six parachutes were seen before the aircraft crashed at La Gombretiere,
					Aizenay, nine miles northwest of La Roche-sur-Yon, France. {32 missions}.   MACR 3540.

					damaged on a mission to the aircraft industries at Warnemünde, Germany 25Jul43 (10RTD).
					The target was covered by clouds and no bombs were dropped. The Combat Wing proceeded
					out into the Baltic Sea. About five minutes after leaving the target area, the lead bombardier of the
					388th Bomb Group spotted a good target of opportunity, the Luftwaffe airfield at Rerik-West,
					near the Wustrow peninsula. Struck by flak on return from the target, an engine failed and the
					propeller feathered. Rapidly using fuel to maintain protection from the Group, the plane ran
					out of fuel on the Knettishall crosswind at 800 feet. But the pilot was able to dead stick into
					the nearby airfield of RAF East Wretham, Thetford, Norfolk that had been used by British bombers.
					The green gear lights came on just as the plane touched down (the pilot initially ordered "gear up",
					predicting a crash landing). The three overworked engines were replaced but, because of the lack of
					spares, the flak damaged No.1 engine was repaired and recertified for flight. Battle damaged on a
					mission to the Gerhard Fieseler Werke (GFW) aircraft works at Waldau, Kassel, Germany 30Jul43 (10RTD).
					A large force of enemy fighters was encountered along the route from the Dutch coast to the
					target and out, but broke off the attacks over the target area. Flak was moderate over the route,
					but intense and accurate over the target. Further flak was encountered on return over Antwerp.
					Participated in a shuttle mission to the Messerschmitt aircraft factories at Regensburg, Germany 17Aug43.
					After the target, the bomber turned south and headed for the Twelfth Air Force base at Bône, Algeria.
					While flying over the Mediterranean, the crew determined that they were running low on fuel.
					They decided to leave the formation and fly a more direct route to reach Bône. As a result,
					this bomber arrived at the Algerian airfield before the rest of the bombers. They were met by a
					contingent of high-ranking officers who were expecting to see the mission leader,
					Brigadier General Curtis LeMay, step out of the plane. The officials seemed somewhat startled to see
					a Lieutenant crawl out of the bomber's hatch to greet them instead. On return to England, operated
					a mission to a Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 24Aug43. The bomber suffered
					battle damage and, with fuel exhaustion, the engines quit while the aircraft was preparing to land at base.
					Crash landed one mile east of Stanton, south of Knettishall, Suffolk. {8 missions}. Salvaged 31Aug43..
					No serious injuries to crew.  Was reported as being captured by Luftwaffe.
					It is probable that this aircraft was not captured.  There is photographic
					and written evidence which appears to prove that aircraft
					was wrecked when bellylanded near Stanton, England Aug 24, 1943 after running
					out of fuel during return from mission.  .  Salvaged Aug 31, 1943.

					bomb with a screwdriver, one after another. At this moment, the bomber was the target of a
					group of German fighter planes. They attacked the bomber several times and damaged the
					two working engines as well. The crew bailed out, the pilot had activated the auto-pilot to
					stabilise the aircraft, but it was too badly damaged. Without the pilot at the controls,
					the aircraft flew a curve, gradually lost altitude over the next few minutes, and landed
					softly without the crew a few kilometers away on the meadow near the small village of
					Dorla, near Lichtenau, twelve miles southwest of Kassel, Germany. The bomber was destroyed
					by fire. {2 missions}.  MACR 3133.

					{first combat mission 12Aug43}. Participated in a shuttle mission to the Messerschmitt aircraft factories
					at Regensburg, Germany 17Aug43. After the target, the mission continued on to North Africa. The plane
					was damaged by flak and the wings were dented by empty shell cases ejected from other bombers.
					En route to Africa, the plane passed over the Alps when the oxygen ran out and it had to leave formation
					for a lower altitude. Then an engine stopped with fuel exhaustion. Fuel was transferred from another
					tank but that engine then stopped. The plane force landed on a dried up lake bed in Algeria.
					Spotting flares in the distance, the crew found two gunners and a pilot of two B-17s forced down
					several days previously. Food, water and gasoline was dropped by parachute and took off two
					days later with the additional crew. Telergma, Constantine, Algeria. Returned to Framlingham
					25Aug43. Damaged aborting from a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Meucon, Vannes, France 23Sep43.
					The landing gear would not extend and the plane circled Framlingham for three and a half hours,
					taking time out to jettison the bomb load and ball turret in The Wash. Base personnel travelled forty
					miles to obtain a motion picture camera to record the crash landing for future instruction of other pilots.
					Failed to return from a mission to the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory at Pozna?, Poland 20Feb44 (10POW).
					Heavy cloud cover over Pozna? forced the formation to divert to their secondary target, the Heinkel
					Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory at Marienehe, Rostock, Germany. During the mission, the pilot reported
					that he could not transfer fuel from the 'Tokyo' fuel tanks. The reserve tanks had been hit by flak over
					the target and fuel had been seen pouring out. Shortly after, the bomber left the formation and the
					pilot said that he would try to get to Sweden. The pilots made a perfect wheels up-landing at Tirstrup,
					Denmark, and all of the crew could leave the plane unharmed. The Americans were very disappointed
					when they learned from Danes crowding in that they had landed in Denmark. The crew removed a
					machine gun and a sack of oranges from the plane and set it on fire. Shortly afterwards the Germans
					arrived, but they could not prevent the plane from burning down completely. The ten Americans went
					on towards the coast, but they left a clear track of orange peels. As no oranges were sold in either
					Denmark or Germany, the Germans just had to follow the track, and by the evening six Americans
					were captured at Hyllested, about 10km from the site of the forced landing. The remaining four airmen
					slept in two holiday cottages on the beach south of Grenaa. Eight days after the forced landing the

					In poor visibility, collided mid-air with B-17F 42-3290 "Raunchy Wolf" (385th Bomb Group), crashed Tillingham
					Hall Farm, Bulphan, near West Horndon, Essex. On the evening of September 26th 1943 "Raunchy Wolf" c
					ollided with  "Dorsal Queen" also from the 385th Bomb Group in bad weather upon return from a
					mission to Reims. The "Raunchy Wolf" was feathering two engines and was having difficulties
					maintaining formation near the landing. Suddenly the aircraft went vertical spinning downward
					hitting its wing across the fuselage of the "Dorsal Queen", completely severing the tail at the rear
					near the waist gunner section. The "Raunchy Wolf" went in at a deep spiral and the "Dorsal Queen"
					in a flat spin towards the ground, crashing at Tillingham Hall Farm, Bulphan, near West-Hordon
					Exeter England. "Raunchy Wolf" exploded and left a 30ft (10m) crater upon impact with bomb
					load on board. The "Dorsal Queen" without the tail section hit several trees on descent and
					crashed straddling a ditch leaving a 7 meter crash radius without an explosion at Nuttys Farm.
					The severed tail section landed 300 yards away with the tail gunner still strapped in the
					tail gun section. He was the only survivor and spent the rest of the war serving in the 385th
					operations center as an orderly. Salvaged 28Sep43

					The wreck of the bomber was initially visible in the water because it came down
					 on a sand-ridge named 'Spiek', with only 1,20 meter of water there (4 ft). This was right in
					front of a German light flak training range. They used this stretch of water to shoot on floating
					targets pulled by small tugboats. Near the wreck it was too shallow for a large recovery ship,
					therefore the wreck of the B-17 was not recovered. The wreck was shot up for target practice.
					The remains of the bomber were not visible anymore in the murky water. Away from the shipping lanes,
					on a shallow spot that was avoided by boats, the wreck site was forgotten. The remains of this aircraft
					were discovered in the summer of 1970 during a public works reclamation project in the area.
					Members of the Dutch Air Force recovered several pieces of this aircraft including a propellor blade
					and hub, some of the radar equipment, and varied pieces of airframe. Several hundred pounds
					were crated by the Dutch military and sent back to the United States to McDonnell-Douglas,
					St. Louis, MO, to take part in a special diagnotic testing and evaluation program to test the
					effects of harsh exposure upon aerospace materials. A testing and evaluations branch at MD
					had been studying pieces of WWII aircraft components salvaged from remote crash sites
					in different climate zones. At the end of the testing and evaluation study, all recovered items
					were slated for disposal. A few items were to be given to museums for display. The bulk of the test
					items, however, were deemed as nothing other than scrap and were to have been destroyed.
					A historically minded McDonnell-Douglas engineer involved in the testing program decided
					instead to filter them directly to another "museum" - located in his suburban home's basement
					and garage. He kept them safe and sound until he passed away 30 years later. The items are
					believed to be displayed in a museum near Mesa, AZ

					Shot down by Lt Alfred Grislawski in Bf 109G-5/R-6 of JG 50/1 .
					One engine was shut down and the propeller feathered but the other engine continued to produce power.
					The aircraft was dropping back from formation and unable to continue to the target. The pilot turned
					south to follow the River Rhine to Switzerland. Further enemy fighter attacks damaged the internal
					communications between crew members, particularly the gunners in the rear. With the co-pilot
					injured and the second engine now failed, the pilot lowered the landing gear as a sign of surrender.
					Unable to advise the gunners, they continued to fire at the enemy fighters which fought back
					ferociously causing more damage to the bomber. By the time that the gunners had been
					appraised of the situation, the aircraft was too low to bail out but two gunners did jump,
					one being killed as he was too low for his parachute to open. The co-pilot regained
					consciousness to find himself alone in the cockpit. The other officers were down at the
					escape hatch when the co-pilot managed to bring the aircraft back under control just
					as it hit the top of some trees, knocking off the landing gear. Fortunately, the bomber was
					heading for an open field and a haystack which it went through destroying it in a flurry of hay.
					The plane stopped but had been broken in two from which the remaining crew emerged
					without serious injury. The crew was inexperienced and only on their second combat mission.

					Crossing the Danish coast en route to the target, a few bursts of flak caused some holes in the
					wings. Nearing Gdynia, a couple of bursts exploded and did some damage behind No.3 engine
					and there was a ragged place out on the aileron. Battle damaged on a mission to the Kugelfischer-
					Georg-Schäfer ball bearing factory at Schweinfurt, Germany 14Oct43 (10RTD). Enemy fighters
					were encountered near Eupen, Belgium on the route in, all the way to the target, and back to the
					French Coast. Flak was moderate to intense along the route but gave the most trouble over the
					target area. The lead bombardier was unable to see a clear view of the target caused by smoke
					from previous bombing. He set his bomb sight on the railway bridge over the Main river
					so that the bombs struck the eastern end of the marshalling yards. On return, force landed
					at RAF Kenley, Kent. Failed to return from a mission to the port at Bremen, Germany 26Nov43 (10KIA).
					As the formation made a sharp turn after the target, an unrecognized B-17 with a triangle
					on its tail and "FC 2" on its right waist began weaving around the formation. It slammed
					into this plane and sheared off the tail. The mystery plane, initially thought to be a
					German-captured Fortress employing ramming tactics, was later identified as B-17G 42-37838
					of the 401st Bomb Group, flying on their first mission. The vertical stabiliser of #317 knocked
					off the ball turret of #838, sending the gunner to his death. The tail section of #317

					attacks against the planes. Over the target, the formation encountered intense flak.
					Just after dropping the bomb load, a Fw 190 released a rocket which exploded under
					the bomber. The nose compartment was badly damaged and the bombardier wounded.
					The navigator assisted the bombardier in bailing out to become a POW. The rocket had
					set a wing on fire and then another German fighter fired cannon shells which wounded

					jolt; it had been rammed by the other plane, B-17F 42-30334. The pilot ordered the crew
					to bail out. The enlisted men tried to open the entry door but it wouldn't budge.
					Then the co-pilot called to cancel the bail out order. One of the engines was smoking but
					the propeller was feathered. The plane couldn't keep up with the formation and so turned
					back for England. The pilot dropped down low over the tree tops to avoid German fighters.
					It landed at RAF Woodbridge emergency landing airfield, Suffolk. Battle damaged on a

					{first combat mission 12Aug43}. Accident during a mission to the Citroen airplane engine
					factory at Meulan, Paris, France 26Sep43 (1KIA:9RTD); the radio operator died of anoxia. Battle
					damaged during a mission to the industrial area of Emden, Germany 2Oct43. Battle damaged
					on a mission to railway installations at Münster, Germany 10Oct43. As they approached
					the city, the formation was swarmed by a large force of enemy aircraft for an estimated
					forty-five minutes of vicious fighting. By the time their friendly fighter escorts arrived to
					drive off the Luftwaffe, the damage had already been done. The No.3 engine was struck by
					flak before reaching the target and began trailing smoke. The plane lost altitude but the
					pilot made a solo run to bomb the target. Turning for home and alone, the bomber made
					an easy target for the German fighters. The pilot dived down into cloud cover at 16,000ft.
					A fighter was shot down by the top turret gunner. Entering another bank of cloud at 3,000ft,
					by this time the No.4 engine was on fire as the bomber entered Dutch airspace. Avoiding the
					flak defences around Rotterdam, the pilot headed out across the North Sea, so low that salt
					spray was soaking the waist gunners. With the fire still raging, the pilot prepared the crew for
					ditching. Just then he spotted a large rolling wave. Gambling that it might extinguish the fire,
					the pilot dropped down lower and the wave washed over the wing. As the throttles were opened
					wide to prevent the bomber from stalling on striking the surface, the fire was out and the pilot
					made a successful emergency landing at a fighter base in East Anglia. As the bomber touched down,
					the No.4 propeller spun off and rolled ahead down the runway. Battle damaged on a mission to
					railway installations at Münster, Germany 10Oct43. As they approached the city, the formation
					was swarmed by a large force of enemy aircraft for an estimated forty-five minutes of vicious
					fighting. By the time their friendly fighter escorts arrived to drive off the Luftwaffe, the damage
					had already been done. The bomber was hit by an aerial rocket from a Bf-110, the right wing
					was almost sheared off about twelve feet from the tip, and the aircraft was forced to leave the
					formation. By using the trim tabs, excess left rudder and help from the Bombardier who, with
					the pilots, pulled on the control column, they were able to get the bomber headed home.
					As the "Eightball" proceeded across the North Sea, the enemy fighters left, but trouble still loomed.
					The engines were laboring very hard in holding altitude and escaping the enemy fighters.
					Also the engines were very noisy and it was questionable whether they would last long enough
					to get the plane to England. As the aircraft approached the 390th Bomb Group home base at
					Framlingham, the weather closed in with almost zero visibility. After making one unsuccessful pass,
					the Control Tower ordered "Eightball" to proceed to Thorpe Abbotts (Station 139), Norfolk,
					home of the 100th Bomb Group. Before landing at the 100th, one engine was feathered and another
					engine was providing minimum power. The landing was rather rough, due to lack of visibility,
					drag from the damaged wing and inadequate power from the engines. The plane overran and
					ended up in a small ditch off the runway. The crew was very relieved to be down with no one harmed.
					Transferred to 571st BS. Named "Flak Hack"--'Flak Hack' was written

					Later positioned to Telergma, Constantine, Algeria. Returned to Framlingham on a mission to a

					Friedrichstrasse railway station, Berlin, Germany 7May44 (1WIA:9RTD). Take off was normal
					and all went well until the bomber met heavy flak between the I.P. and the target. There were
					faults with two of the engines and also problems with the oxygen supply. The plane could not
					keep up with the group, so the crew jettisoned the bombs and set course for home. The pilots
					decided to make the run home at about twenty-five feet above ground to avoid enemy fighters or
					being spotted on enemy radar. As they hurtled along, skimming just above hedges, trees and power
					cables, people flattened themselves on the ground as the B-17 roared by. Then the plane came to
					what appeared to be a fortification but soon proved to be the dyke of a canal, complete with German
					gunners on barges who hit them with 20mm rounds. The ball turret gunner came out of his turret and
					stood in the radio room, thinking he would be safer in the aircraft. Somewhat ironically, he was the
					only crew member to be injured by the barge gunners. The gunners also severed the trim tab cables
					which caused the nose to drop. The B-17 would have ploughed in had it not plunged through the trees
					and lifted the nose as the pilots fought to recover control. Fortunately, over the sea the crew saw a
					P-38 Lightning and a P-47 Thunderbolt who escorted them home where the plane made a normal landing.
					The ground crew had a lot of work to do. One propeller was split, the Plexiglas was shattered, the
					leading edges and engine cowls were smashed and there were holes and foliage everywhere.
					There was broken glass and sea water in the ball turret. {final combat mission 13Sep44}. {61 missions}.

					Failed to return from a mission to the harbor at Piraeus, Greece 11Jan44 (7KIA:3RTD). Mid-air collision
					and crashed at Kalavatra, Greece. On that fateful day, the briefed mission was for the 5th Wing
					composed of the 2nd, 97th, 301st and 99th Bomb Groups, to fly on a southerly course through the
					heel of Italy to the town of Lecce where the Wing would then take a heading out over the Adriatic Sea,
					to a point over the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece. From this point the crews were briefed to
					complete a 90° degree turn to the Initial Point over Lagousa Island. From there the mission
					dictated a straight run in to the target, reassemble, and return to base. After the formation
					was organized and began making its way to the target, the Groups ran into a weather front of 10/10 clouds.
					At eighteen thousand feet they entered an overcast. The clouds were very thick and visibility
					was not much beyond the wingtips, making it almost impossible to see other aircraft in the formation.
					At that altitude, and with the thickness of the clouds, ice began to form on their wings. In such
					situations it was standard operating procedure for trailing squadrons in the formation to fly
					off course for a couple minutes to obtain some spacing from the lead squadron, which would
					continue to maintain its course. However, as the 97th Bomb Group began making a left turn
					for their bomb run on the target, the lead plane of the 342nd Bomb Squadron encountered
					severe turbulence made by the preceding elements of the Wing. The turbulence was so severe
					that the lead aircraft of the squadron was forced into a steep left bank before it plummeted
					temporarily out of control and lost altitude at a rate of 1,000ft per minute. By the time the pilot
					was able to recover and regain his place in formation, the two sister planes in the flight were
					nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the pilots of the two sister planes from the flight,
					B-17F No.42-3251 and B-17F No.42-29918 found themselves alone in 10/10 visibility, unsure
					where the formation had disappeared to, with ice forming on their wings, and experiencing
					engine trouble. From what was deduced later in the accident report, the doomed B-17s made the
					decision to abort and turn back for the relative safety of Italy. In a tragic turn of events, their
					decision to return home took them directly into the path of the oncoming 301st Bomb Group.
					According to the official report of the Board of Inquiry, the two B-17s of the 97th Bomb Group
					experienced engine trouble and left the formation. Instead of making a 180-degree right turn,
					away from the formation, the aircraft made a turn to the left and flew head-on into the 301st formation.
					According to a Bombardier assigned to the lead ship of the 301st Bomb Group, and flown
					by the Group Commanding Officer, he was startled to see a pair of 97th Bomb Group B-17s emerge
					out of a cloud about 20 degrees to the left and aimed straight at his aircraft. Almost Instantly,
					both B-17s bracketed his aircraft, with one passing closely over his right wing that clipped the
					vertical stabiliser, and the other closely passing beneath the left wing. Almost immediately,
					the tail gunner witnessed a big ball of fire that lit up the clouds as the B-17s collided with one
					Fortress in the lead element, and two B-17s in the second element. P-38 pilots, flying low cover
					escort under the overcast, reported watching pieces of B-17s raining from the sky for what
					seemed like five minutes. There were eight B-17s that fell out of the sky simultaneously.
					Thirteen Americans survived; 64 perished. {64 missions}

					Named "Dallas Rebel"  Failed to return from a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190
					manufacturing factory at Oschersleben, Germany 28Jul43 (6POW:4KIA). Shot down by enemy
					fighters, crashed North Sea, NW of Frisian Island. The bomber, which was part of a flight of four
					planes within a larger wave of 300, had taken off from Snetterton Heath to strike the Focke-Wulf
					sub-contractor factory in Oschersleben. As the planes approached Germany's northern coast,
					approximately thirty miles west of the islands of Heligoland, German fighters intercepted and
					attacked the flight of bombers. One by one, the fighters knocked out the three other aircraft in the
					formation, leaving Dallas Rebel alone to defend itself. In an effort to protect his aircraft,
					the pilot flew the B-17 into a larger formation of bombers. But shortly thereafter three enemy
					fighters singled his aircraft out, and 20mm cannon fire from the German aircraft punched holes
					in Dallas Rebel from its left wing across to its right. The pilot started evasive action and slid
					under the lead ship for protection, but not quickly enough to avoid cannon fire through the
					radio room and out the right wing. The ball turret gunner had time to blow up the lead fighter,
					but the other two got away. As the bomber started to descend from its damage, its gunners
					continued to defend the Flying Fortress and managed to shoot down two more of the
					attacking German fighters. Three more followed it down. The tail-gunner blew up one,
					and a waist gunner got another. The attack set fire to the bomb bay and disabled the
					bomber's intercom system. In an effort to extinguish the fire, the pilot put the aircraft
					into a dive, and the crewmen saw that the left wing had been partly burned away,
					its internal structure - including fuel tanks - exposed. Shortly thereafter, the fire spread.
					Suddenly, large quantities of fuel poured out of the left wing tanks. The crew felt a large
					bump when the fuel ignited, and all four engines stopped. While the aircraft was headed
					for a controlled crash into the North Sea, four of its crew members chose to bail out by
					parachute and were never recovered. When the aircraft was nearing the water's surface,
					the pilot leveled out to burn off speed and set the aircraft up for a smooth water landing.
					Its survival dinghies were deployed. After escaping the sinking plane, the remaining six
					crew men crammed onto their one small survival raft. As they righted themselves in their
					dinghy, the sinking plane exploded in the water beneath them. They had paddles, a flare gun,
					a hand-powered radio, two parachutes, and a small survival kit with chocolate bars and
					fresh water. They resourcefully used parachutes and oxygen bottles that floated up from
					the plane to make a rudimentary sea anchor and measure their drift. The six men floated
					in the cramped rubber dinghy, hoping for rescue. They decided to paddle and crank
					their radio in two-hour shifts. Their first afternoon adrift, the men spotted a large
					predatory shark that had taken an interest in them. The downed airmen helplessly
					watched the shark as it approached their raft. The men keenly watched for any sign of rescue.
					The next day, while adrift, they spotted a German fighter plane in the distance, and
					then a storm brought 15-foot waves that threatened to capsize the dinghy.
					The men were drenched by rain and sea spray, which lasted all day and all night.
					That first evening, they saw several British aircraft and hoped that someone would
					spot them and call for a rescue. British fighters, which had bombed Jutland, dove
					down close to them on their way home but didn't see them. The following morning,
					July 30, nearly 72 hours after the crash, the men awoke to the sound of explosions
					along Germany's northern coast. Three Luftwaffe Ju-52s, each with a mine detector
					ring under it, were exploding mines with machine gun fire. When one noticed the crew,
					it left the formation to return to its base, while the others dropped green and yellow
					sea markers around them. The men knew they had been marked and that they likely
					faced capture. Half an hour later, a German plane showed up. A Do-24 twin-engine
					seaplane soon returned and landed close to the raft. Two guards stood on the pontoons
					with machine guns and motioned the survivors to board the plane.

					Fifteenth Air Force, Italy 1Nov43. Cerignola #1, Italy 10Dec43. Failed to return from a mission
					to the harbor at Piraeus, Greece 11Jan44 (7KIA). After a mid-air collision, the plane crashed near
					Agrambela, Greece. On that fateful day, the briefed mission was for the 5th Wing composed of the
					2nd, 97th, 301st and 99th Bomb Groups, to fly on a southerly course through the heel of Italy
					to the town of Lecce where the Wing would then take a heading out over the Adriatic Sea,
					to a point over the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece. From this point the crews were briefed
					to complete a 90° degree turn to the Initial Point over Lagousa Island. From there the
					mission dictated a straight run in to the target, reassemble, and return to base. After the
					formation was organized and began making its way to the target, the Groups ran into a
					weather front of 10/10 clouds. At eighteen thousand feet they entered an overcast.
					The clouds were very thick and visibility was not much beyond the wingtips, making it a
					lmost impossible to see other aircraft in the formation. At that altitude, and with the
					thickness of the clouds, ice began to form on their wings. In such situations it was standard
					operating procedure for trailing squadrons in the formation to fly off course for a couple
					minutes to obtain some spacing from the lead squadron, which would continue to maintain
					its course. However, as the 97th Bomb Group began making a left turn for their bomb run on
					the target, the lead plane of the 342nd Bomb Squadron encountered severe turbulence
					made by the preceding elements of the Wing. The turbulence was so severe that the lead
					aircraft of the squadron was forced into a steep left bank before it plummeted temporarily
					out of control and lost altitude at a rate of 1,000ft per minute. By the time the pilot was
					able to recover and regain his place in formation, the two sister planes in the flight were
					nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the pilots of the two sister planes from the flight,
					B-17F No.42-3251 and B-17F No.42-29918 found themselves alone in 10/10 visibility,
					unsure where the formation had disappeared to, with ice forming on their wings, and
					experiencing engine trouble. From what was deduced later in the accident report, the
					doomed B-17s made the decision to abort and turn back for the relative safety of Italy.
					In a tragic turn of events, their decision to return home took them directly into the path
					of the oncoming 301st Bomb Group. According to the official report of the Board of Inquiry,
					the two B-17s of the 97th Bomb Group experienced engine trouble and left the formation.
					Instead of making a 180-degree right turn, away from the formation, the aircraft made a
					turn to the left and flew head-on into the 301st formation. According to a Bombardier
					assigned to the lead ship of the 301st Bomb Group, and flown by the Group Commanding
					Officer, he was startled to see a pair of 97th Bomb Group B-17s emerge out of a cloud
					about 20 degrees to the left and aimed straight at his aircraft. Almost Instantly, both
					B-17s bracketed his aircraft, with one passing closely over his right wing that clipped
					the vertical stabiliser, and the other closely passing beneath the left wing. Almost
					immediately, the tail gunner witnessed a big ball of fire that lit up the clouds as the
					B-17s collided with one fortress in the lead element, and two B-17s in the second element.
					 P-38 pilots, flying low cover escort under the overcast, reported watching pieces of B-17s
					raining from the sky for what seemed like five minutes. There were eight B-17s that fell
					out of the sky simultaneously. Thirteen Americans survived; 64 perished. {46 missions}.

					the primary target. There was cloud cover over the secondary target which was the
					Luftwaffe airfield at Beaumont Sur Oise, northwest of Paris. Shortly after it was hit by
					flak en route to the target, it was also hit by 20mm cannon shells in the left wing
					outboard of No.1 engine. The plane lost speed and altitude caused by a large hole
					in the wing. The bombardier jettisoned the bombs near Paris. The plane was reported
					to be under control although the pilot was seen slumped over the wheel but he bailed
					out with the crew. Crashed Houilles, a northwestern suburb of Paris, France. {9 missions}.

					Participated in a shuttle mission to the Messerschmitt aircraft factories at Regensburg, Germany 17Aug43.
					After the target, the bomber turned south and landed at the Twelfth Air Force base at Bône, Algeria.
					Later positioned to Telergma, Algeria. On return to England, operated a mission to a Luftwaffe air
					depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 24Aug43. Battle damaged on an Operation Starkey mission to
					the industrial area of Paris, France 9Sep43. The Fortress was hit in the wing and badly damaged
					over Les Andeleys on the way to attack a target in the Paris area and was forced to leave the
					formation and turn back. Eight German fighters rode high above the crippled bomber in an
					orderly formation to create the impression that it was a friendly escort. Then, when the
					bomber was away from the rest of the formation, the German fighters closed in for the kill.
					The pilot and his co-pilot with their crew members proceeded to dogfight the Fortress
					against its attackers, twisting and turning the bomber in spite of its badly damaged
					wing to expose less target surface to the enemy and to force them to break off their attacks.
					Several huge holes were punched through the left wing by the first attack of two strings of
					enemy fighters when the bomber was approaching Paris. It looked like a 37mm shell from
					the size of the holes. The control cables to the left aileron were shot out and immediately
					the aircraft began to vibrate. It jumped way to the left of the formation, and shook itself
					from that time all the way home. The bombardier opened the bomb bay doors and jettisoned
					the bombs to get rid of their weight. The aircraft tried to keep up with the formation but
					couldn't. Soon after it left it the friendly fighter escort was way up with the leading formation
					and the bomber was alone. It made a slow turn and headed back for the coast. It was losing
					altitude about 1,000ft a minute. Then eight enemy fighters came in and hit the bomber again.
					On their first sweep, the bombardier shot down a Bf 109. When they attacked again,
					The engineer/top turret gunner and the ball turret gunner each shot down another fighter.
					Three of the enemy fighters turned towards home. Only one stayed with the bomber.
					He kept with it all the way to the coast. The crew did a little bit of dogfighting with him.
					They would turn into him as he dived and he would overshoot and have to go on and turn and
					make another pass. He attacked from everywhere, evidently trying to find a position with a
					gun out. He finally made one last approach from the rear. The bomber climbed sharply from
					him and could see a stream of 20mm shells pouring past it just under the wing. The German
					must have used up all his ammunition then. He went far out to the left and started wobbling
					his wings. Near the French coast, the bomber, which was now down to 7,000ft, was startled
					by a terrific barrage of flak, but it weathered that storm and made a forced landing at RAF Ford,
					West Sussex. The crew, which sang "Coming in on a Wing and a Prayer" as they were doing
					just that, was loud in its praise of each other. Failed to return from a mission to the German
					Navy cruiser Nürnberg in the port area of Gdynia, Poland 9Oct43 (4KIA:6POW). The bomber
					was attacked by German fighters on the way home over South Jutland. Struck by a grenade
					shot from Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters so that a fire broke out in the right wing, which
					spread to the aircraft's radio room and bomb bay. The plane slowly dropped out of the
					formation and the bail out was given with the pilot leaving the aircraft last. Shortly after this
					the plane exploded over the North Sea, southwest of Fanø, Denmark. {9 missions}.

					Named  "Shack Rabbit III"  Failed to return from a mission to the industrial area
					at Düren, Germany 20Oct43 (4KIA:6EVD). When the bomber circled above the North Sea
					in order to reach enough altitude to then set course for the Belgian coast, engine No.4
					started to cause problems. In recent weeks there have been a lot of problems with the
					turbochargers within the Group. As the Group climbed, the plane fell behind
					because it didn't have enough power. The question arose: should the crew return or
					continue the mission? The pilot wanted to persevere. In the meantime they had climbed
					close to the required cruising altitude. He reasoned that if the formation dropped
					just a little bit, to about 24,000ft, they would fit back into the formation. But their
					place had already been taken by another aircraft and they now had to fly in the
					unenviable position of "tail end charlie". When they crossed the Belgian coast they saw a
					heavy, dark cloud bank in front of them. It must have been the same weather front that
					caused previous missions to be canceled. As the Group approached the clouds,
					they started to climb and lost this plane again. It was already flying at maximum height and
					could not squeeze anymore out of the engines. Now easy prey, the bomber was attacked by
					enemy fighters in the vicinity of Bergen and Tournai. It was shot down by
					Hauptmann Peter-Paul Steindl of 11./JG 26. Three airmen were killed as the tail was shot
					off, the plane was out of control and the crew bailed out. The aircraft exploded in the air,
					pieces fell on a wide area, the front near Quévaucamps, the tail section near Hensies,

					Mid-air explosion 25 miles south of Rapid City Field, SD 20Jun43 (9KIS). Took off to conduct a typical training
					maneuver, preparing to fire at targets below in a desolate area known as the Badlands about 25 miles
					south of Rapid City. The airplane had been modified with additional internal tankage in the wings at a
					modification center. The explosion was probably caused by the ignition of improperly vented gasoline
					fumes in the wing panel. The airplane was standing by in the gunnery range traffic pattern waiting its
					turn to fire at a towed target when it was seen on fire and breaking up in flight by witnesses on the ground.
					The B-17 fuselage broke in half at the radio room compartment near the starboard wing. Pieces of the
					starboard wing and various fire blackened wreckage were found strewn over an area called Red Shirt Table.
					Investigation of the wreckage revealed that the airplane suffered a catastrophic internal explosion of
					gasoline and air in the starboard wing at an altitude of 3,500 feet above ground level. The damage
					and subsequent fire caused the airplane to break up and crash.

					As it was on the final approach, the air traffic control radio operator stated, "#449, if you have two
					engines out, flash your landing lights," and at that same moment, the pilot opened the throttles and
					pulled up to avoid another B-17 that cut him out of the pattern. On two engines, the increased power
					caused the failure of No.4 engine. The plane was successfully crash landed on a hillside in the dark.
					As the crew tried to exit the radio hatch, they could see flames against the dust. Fortunately it was a

					The navigator bailed out. On that fateful day, the briefed mission was for the 5th Wing composed
					of the 2nd, 97th, 301st and 99th Bomb Groups, to fly on a southerly course through the heel of Italy
					to the town of Lecce where the Wing would then take a heading out over the Adriatic Sea, to a point
					over the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece. From this point the crews were briefed to complete a 90°
					degree turn to the Initial Point over Lagousa Island. From there the mission dictated a straight run
					in to the target, reassemble, and return to base. After the formation was organized and began making
					its way to the target, the Groups ran into a weather front of 10/10 clouds. At eighteen thousand
					feet they entered an overcast. The clouds were very thick and visibility was not much beyond the
					wingtips, making it almost impossible to see other aircraft in the formation. At that altitude, and
					with the thickness of the clouds, ice began to form on their wings. In such situations it was standard
					operating procedure for trailing squadrons in the formation to fly off course for a couple minutes
					to obtain some spacing from the lead squadron, which would continue to maintain its course.
					However, as the 97th Bomb Group began making a left turn for their bomb run on the target, the lead
					plane of the 342nd Bomb Squadron encountered severe turbulence made by the preceding elements
					of the Wing. The turbulence was so severe that the lead aircraft of the squadron was forced into a
					steep left bank before it plummeted temporarily out of control and lost altitude at a rate of 1,000ft per
					minute. By the time the pilot was able to recover and regain his place in formation, the two sister
					planes in the flight were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the pilots of the two sister planes from
					the flight, B-17F No.42-3251 and B-17F No.42-29918 found themselves alone in 10/10 visibility,
					unsure where the formation had disappeared to, with ice forming on their wings, and experiencing
					engine trouble. From what was deduced later in the accident report, the doomed B-17s made the
					decision to abort and turn back for the relative safety of Italy. In a tragic turn of events, their
					decision to return home took them directly into the path of the oncoming 301st Bomb Group.
					According to the official report of the Board of Inquiry, the two B-17s of the 97th Bomb Group
					experienced engine trouble and left the formation. Instead of making a 180-degree right turn,
					away from the formation, the aircraft made a turn to the left and flew head-on into the 301st formation.
					According to a Bombardier assigned to the lead ship of the 301st Bomb Group, and flown by the
					Group Commanding Officer, he was startled to see a pair of 97th Bomb Group B-17s emerge out
					of a cloud about 20 degrees to the left and aimed straight at his aircraft. Foggia #8 (Longskirt), Lucera,

					escort under the overcast, reported watching pieces of B-17s raining from the sky for what seemed

					{first combat mission 13Aug43}. Failed to return from a mission to bomb an electrical transformer
					station and railway marshalling yards in Foggia, Italy 19Aug43 (5KIA:4MIA:1POW). Enemy fighters
					swarmed about the bombers both to and from the target area. Over the city of Foggia the flak was
					intense. At an altitude of 21,000ft, the bomber managed to reach the target area intact and completed
					its bombing run. On the return home, enemy fighters attacked once more; this time they hit the bomber
					hard. The aircraft was riddled by machine gun fire from several of the Bf 109s. One wing was nearly
					blown off and the plane's No.2 and No.3 engines were on fire. One by one the guns in the rear of the
					plane stopped firing. The five gunners were badly injured or dead. Crippled and falling out of the sky,
					the bomber was surrounded by enemy fighters. The pilot gave the order to bail out. The five remaining
					crew members bailed out at 19,000ft over the Tyrrhenian Sea, south of Salerno and ten miles west
					of Licosa Point. The co-pilot called out to his crew members once he hit the water, but got no response.

					over Berwick flying very low and crashed into the sea off Spittal. The weather was the worst. Berwick lifeboat
					and a Royal Air Force rescue boat immediately put out to the scene of the crash, but no bodies were found.
					It attempted to tow the aircraft to land but it sank. On August 10, a team of divers endeavour to salvage the
					plane and recover the bodies. After three days' unsuccessful attempts to locate the Fortress, the men left Berwick.
					The crash was the result of equipment failure, training procedure failures and weather. The bomber had
					radio aids failure beyond the point of no return and the crew was unable to recognise/remedy/repair the fault.
					All northern UK (except Prestwick as usual) was covered in low cloud and fog. The crew were being tracked
					but would not answer radio calls for diversion after they overflew the west coast of Scotland. No aircraft could
					be scrambled from closer bases to intercept because of the weather and Prestwick aircraft were tasked

					Combat Crew Training School, 395th Bomb Group, Ardmore Field, OK. Mid-air collision with B-17F 42-30752
					near Mill Creek, twenty miles northeast of Ardmore 12Feb44 (10KIS). The bomber crew was tasked to participate
					in a low level bombing demonstration during the base 'open house' held that day. The mission for the day was
					to fly to Matagorda Bay, just off the coast from Corpus Christi, Texas. They fired at tow targets for several hours,
					then headed back to Ardmore. There were 13 B-17s flying in close formation. One B-17 with officer instructors
					brought up the rear and advised the pilots as to what to do. They had been flying at 20,000ft this day and as
					we neared home, we began to descend and turn at the same time. This is a difficult maneuver for a large plane
					to accomplish, especially if in close formation under turbulent air conditions. The bomber was flying in a
					very close formation with planes on both sides and in the front and rear. They had let down to approximately
					15,000ft when the aircraft (42-30752) on the upper left slid into this aircraft. The two right engines
					cut this plane into two pieces just behind the radio room. The front of the aircraft went straight up for a
					brief moment knocking off the Plexiglas nose of the other plane which pushed this aircraft under it
					knocking off its ball turret. The tail gunner, who parachuted successfully, was the only survivor
					of the crew on this flight. The pilots of 42-30572 managed to regain control, although heavily damaged
					with two right engines inoperable, they flew the 15-20 miles to Ardmore Field and landed safely. Salvaged 13Feb44..

					The aircraft took off from Ephrata AAB on a training bombing mission. Returning from the mission, the
					bomber was circling to land in a left turn with the flaps partially extended and landing gear extended
					when it struck the side of a hill and rolled roughly 200 yards on the landing gear. The No.2 engine
					propeller struck a horse knocking off the engine and left landing gear which collided with the
					left horizontal stabiliser and elevator, knocking them off. this caused the bomber to bounce back
					into the air 100 feet before colliding with another hill and sliding 400 yards before breaking up and
					bursting into flames roughly a half mile from the first contact with the ground.

					there was anti-aircraft fire from the ground and a few attacks by enemy fighters which, however,
					had no effect. Most of the remaining distance was flown between two layers of cloud at an altitude
					of 6,000 meters. North of the Alps, the formation encountered a deep, closed cloud cover that
					stretched far to the north. Because of a thick overcast over southern Germany, the mission was
					aborted 50km from Augsburg. The formation then turned back towards Italy. In the middle of the
					reversal maneuver, about thirty German Bf 109G-6 fighters of JG 3/8 attacked and pursued them
					southwards. Without realizing it, the Americans flew over Switzerland near Lake Constance under
					constant fire. Damaged, and with the bombardier wounded by a 20mm cannon shell, the plane force
					landed without brakes at Cagliari, Sardinia and collided with another B-17. Returned to Oudna 2Oct43. Salvaged Oct43.

					led a training mission in the bomber from Chanute Field. The flight headed to the pilot's hometown

					bombing missions over targets in Sicily and Italy. The B-17 was an odd sight to the residents of Dubuque
					since there were no B-17 bases near Dubuque. The residents were surprised to see the B-17 roar over their
					town at low altitude that day. The B-17 made two low passes past Heller's Tavern off old Highway 20.
					Soon after the low pass, the right wing of the bomber clipped a tree, and the pilot corrected, sending
					the bomber into a stall. The plane crashed and burst into flames, killing all five men on board.
					It was speculated that the pilot was flying low over the tavern to get the attention of a girl that
					worked there at the time. Salvaged 10Feb44

					Rapid City Field, SD 5Jul43. Force landed after engine failure twenty-five miles east of Hermosa, SD 5Feb44.
					While on a practice bombing mission in South Dakota, there was a fire in the bomb bay door motor.
					After trying to turn the doors back up with the manual handle, the crew lost each of the four engines
					in turn from carburetor icing. By this time they were too low to jump and the crew went into their
					practiced 'toboggan' mode in the radio room. Meanwhile the pilot and co-pilot attempted to crash
					land the B-17. The pilot made such a perfect, smooth landing on a snow-covered wheat field that the
					aircraft neither bounced nor even suffered a hangnail. The crew was then treated by the Colonel
					to 'the best steaks in South Dakota'. The pilot's crash landing had been so gentle, that after fixing the
					propellers and lifting it, Colonel Hunter, the CO of the 398th Bomb Group, flew the B-17 out of the
					wheat field on a metal-grid runway. 225th Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station), Rapid City

 					Failed to return from a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical works at Oppau, Ludwigshafen,

					A burst struck the navigator's compartment, another severely damaged one of the four engines,

					was hit by flak was shot down by Hptm Herbert Huppertz in Fw 190A-6

					{first combat mission 7Sep43}. Failed to return from a mission to the submarine construction yard at
					Vegesack, Bremen, Germany 16Dec43 (6MIA:2POW:2EVD). The supercharger was running rough on the \
					No.3 engine. There was also a problem transferring gasoline to that engine. Consequently, about 30 miles
					from the coast the plane slowly dropped out of the formation. It was assumed that the pilot was aborting
					the mission, even though it was thought all four engines were running properly. The navigator set a course
					to intercept the formation before reaching the target. Just before reaching the target, the fuel-starved
					No.3 engine went dead and the propeller began windmilling. The pilot and co-pilot worked to feather
					the propeller but to no avail. Meanwhile, the target was approaching and covered with clouds. Perhaps
					due to the struggle and confusion of keeping up it appears that the bombardier dropped the bomb
					load at the IP. To avoid a concentration of flak to the west of Bremen, the formation made a planned
					turn to the left and headed directly south before again changing course due west toward England.
					Now lagging dangerously behind and below the main formation, the pilot and his crew struggled on.
					Twenty minutes after the target, the Luftwaffe arrived. This was the only B-17 out of formation and \
					flying somewhere between 23,000 and 26,000ft. Down below, the overcast reached up to about 7,000ft.
					The pilot knew that if he could reach that overcast, they might just make it. The surviving crew stated
					the attacking aircraft were Bf 109s and Ju 88s. The Ju 88s were likely night fighters of I/NJG2 that were
					also tasked with attacking B-17s in daylight. Somewhere during that time, the control cables in the
					left waist area were cut and an exploding 20mm shell wounded the radio operator. They were hit
					again and the interphone was shot out. By this time they were at 1,000ft altitude. Four crewmen
					bailed out. The bomber probably crashed in Ijsselmer, near Urk, Netherlands. {9 missions}, MACR 1556

					After being struck by flak prior to the target, the pilot was unable to keep up with enough speed to

					the plane was still under control and seemed to be heading for Switzerland. The crew bailed out

					502nd Bomb Squadron, 346th Bomb Group, Dyersburg Field, TN 27Jul43. Crashed between
					Palmersville and Latham, TN 5Sep43 (8KIS::1DOI:1RTD). The bomber was en route to a
					rendezvous point for a mission in Gulfport, Mississippi. At 8,000ft the flight indicator
					went out and the pilot had considerable difficulty in flying the airplane under instrument
					conditions. It appeared as though, after getting into the clear, the pilot continued to
					climb and went into the overcast again trying to reach 20,000ft, though the bombardier
					states the airplane exceeded the maximum safe operation conditions which placed a great
					strain on the airplane. It is believed because of the statements of the co-pilot and bombardier
					concerning this attitude of flight and the loss of control surface that the airplane went out
					of control and into a spin, thereby disintegrating and crashing. The co-pilot noticed excessive
					cylinder head temperatures on engines No.1, 3 and 4, and opened the cowl flaps. Then there
					was a explosion that jolted the plane and it went off into a spiral to the right. The plane
					levelled off but immediately it went off to the left in a spin. Then after a few seconds of being tossed
					around, the fuselage broke right at the top turret. Salvaged 30Sep43.

					Failed to return from a mission to bomb a railway marshalling yard at Rimini, Italy 27Nov43 (8KIA:2POW).
					A few minutes before nearing the target the formation encountered heavy overcast, parts of which were
					broken and towering. An engine lost power and the plane was forced to leave its position in the flight and
					jettison the bombs. This plane had difficulty in keeping up, but soon the group flew over a town heading
					out to sea. The circle which the group was making out to sea was in order to get a good run on target.
					The pilot cut the corner to catch up with the group. As the plane approached land, slightly ahead of the
					more rapidly moving group coming in, the pilot made a short turn to the left and went into a nearby
					overcast. About this time, still in the overcast, and as it broke out, the No.3 engine began to lose power,
					slowing the speed even more. About this time, about twenty-five Bf 109 German fighter aircraft were
					coming in to attack. The first burst of fighter fire raked the B-17, apparently from the tail to the nose.
					The engineer/top turret gunner died instantly. Soon the No.2 engine and the entire left wing were on fire.
					The crew were starting to bail out as the plane exploded. The two survivors, right waist gunner and co-pilot,
					were knocked unconscious and ejected by the explosion. The plane crashed near Apecchio, SSW of Rimini, Italy

					Ardmore Field, OK 12Feb44. The bomber crew was tasked to participate in a low level bombing
					demonstration during the base 'open house' held that day. The mission for the day was to fly to
					Matagorda Bay, just off the coast from Corpus Christi, Texas. They fired at tow targets for
					several hours, then headed back to Ardmore. There were 13 B-17s flying in close formation.
					One B-17 with officer instructors brought up the rear and advised the pilots as to what to do.
					They had been flying at 20,000ft this day and as we neared home, we began to descend and turn
					at the same time. This is a difficult maneuver for a large plane to accomplish, especially if in
					close formation under turbulent air conditions. The bomber was flying in a very close formation
					with planes on both sides and in the front and rear. They had let down to approximately 15,000ft
					when the aircraft slid into aircraft 42-30752. The two right engines cut the other plane into two
					pieces just behind the radio room. The front of that aircraft went straight up for a brief moment
					knocking off the Plexiglas nose of this plane which pushed that aircraft under it knocking off its
					ball turret. The pilots of 42-30572 managed to regain control, although heavily damaged with
					two right engines inoperable, they flew the 15-20 miles to Ardmore Field and landed safely.

					The bomber took off on a 1,000 mile night navigation training mission from Sioux City Army
					Air Base 18/19Apr44 (10RTD). About ten to fifteen miles west of Marquette, MI, No.3 engine was
					reported to have an oil leak to the propeller governor. Attempts to feather the propeller failed and
					the pilot headed across Lake Superior to Duluth, MN for a forced landing. Then the engine
					caught fire but, without fire extinguishers, the fire could not be extinguished. A few minutes
					later the inboard cylinders blew up and blew off the cowling. The engine was burning fiercely and the
					unfeathered propeller was causing excess drag. Turning towards land, as pieces of the engine
					continued to blow off, the order to bail out was given. Set on autopilot, all the crew bailed out safely.
					The plane crashed on the snow-covered Porcupine mountains thirty miles southwest of Ontonagon, MI i
					n the early hours of 19Apr44. The first four crewmen to bail out landed almost on the beach of
					Lake Superior at Union Bay, MI, and walked to Silver City. By that morning, a Civil Air Patrol spotter
					had located the wrecked plane. By noon, all but one of the crew had been rescued. Tail gunner was
					found two days later walking down a remote logging road. Salvaged 20Apr44..

					target area, the bomber formation was repeatedly attacked by a large number of Luftwaffe
					fighters. After the target, the Group turned and headed westward for England. German fighters,
					having landed and refueled, attacked again until, finally, the bombers reached the coastline
					of western Europe and relative safety. 20mm cannon shells struck the No.1 and 4 propellers,
					right wing and aileron, right horizontal stabiliser, right fuselage. Flak struck the tail gunner's
					compartment, left side of nose and left inner wing over the No.2 main fuel tank. Seriously battle
					 damaged during a mission to the port area at Kiel, Germany 13Dec43. No.4 engine struck by flak.
					About thirty minutes before the target the plane was struck by flak. The whole formation made a 360
					degree turn somewhere near the I.P. As the turn straightened out the No.4 engine started to misfire,
					a second later the propeller began to windmill, the engine cowling came off and the plane dropped
					back as the formation flew on. The crew dropped the bombs somewhere near the target but not on it.
					The plane was steadily losing altitude and came out of the undercast about twenty-five feet above a
					Danish island. They were right over a German convoy. Simultaneously a Ju 88 attacked. The bomber
					pilot did some fast evasive action through a mist just off the water and finally lost the Ju 88. By this time
					an engine had caught on fire, so the pilot and co-pilot decided to turn around and land in Denmark.
					As the plane came in sight of the Danish coast the engine fire went out, so the pilot turned for the
					North Sea and England. The plane was down about 200 feet above the water. After ten minutes the Ju 88
					came back in for another attack. The bomber was fast approaching a six-ship German convoy.
					The fighter started to come in at the same level ahead of the bomber. Just as it broke to point its nose,
					the bomber pilot turned into his direction. The Ju 88 continued to come. As it passed, the top turret and
					the bombardier in the nose started firing and the fighter started trailing black smoke. It disappeared
					into the mist, engine burning and smoking. All this tine the German ship convoy was firing machine
					guns and flak at the bomber. Fortunately, none of the crew had been hit, and as far as they could
					determine the bomber was undamaged. The pilot was having trouble holding the small altitude
					he had and called for all spare ammunition and all extra equipment to be thrown out to lighten the
					load. Finally the plane came in over the English coast and landed an hour later than the briefed ETA.
					Failed to return from a mission to the Junkers aircraft factory at Halberstadt, Germany 11Jan44 (2POW:5EVD:3KIA).
					The formation encountered some light flak en route and over the target. After leaving the target
					the formation was attacked by a Bf 110 fighter and then by 30 to 35 Fw 190 fighters. The aircraft

					on a mission to railway installations at Münster, Germany 10Oct43. As they approached the city,
					the formation was swarmed by a large force of enemy aircraft for an estimated forty-five minutes
					of vicious fighting. By the time their friendly fighter escorts arrived to drive off the Luftwaffe, the
					damage had already been done. Severely battle damaged on a mission to the Deschimag submarine
					construction yard at Vegesack, Bremen, Germany 20Dec43 (5POW:1WIA:4RTD). En route to the
					target area, the 390th Bomb Group encountered a large force of enemy fighters, many armed
					with rockets. The plane suffered severe flak and fighter damage with two engines out of commission
					and having trouble with a third one. The plane had been badly shot up and the communications
					were out. The pilot dove for the ground because there were two fighters on to them. The bombardier
					had been wounded and the gunners thought they were going down (so did the fighters, so they left)
					and bailed out near Wilhelmshaven. The plane was so low when it leveled out, it was coming
					up for the trees. The crew was over the Netherlands and saw that people in the fields kept pointing
					in a certain direction. It took them a minute to realize that the people were pointing towards England
					and would have been shot if the Nazis had seen them do it. The pilot brought the aircraft and
					remaining crew back to force land at a fighter base, Raydon (Station 157), Suffolk. When they landed,
					the crew counted 780 holes in the aircraft from the flak and fighters. Failed to return from a mission
					to the Messerschmitt factory in Augsburg, Germany 16Mar44 (8KIA:2POW). From Strasburg, Germany
					to Augsburg, the bombers were attacked by Luftwaffe fighters in a running battle. Flak over the target
					was moderate and accurate; flak en route was meagre and inaccurate. As the Group was passing near
					Nördlingen, almost forty miles north of Augsburg, the plane was struck by rockets fired by enemy fighters,
					which started a fire aboard the aircraft. With its wings and fuselage engulfed in flames, it promptly fell
					out of formation and exploded. The wreckage crashed on Lautern, six miles east of Schwäbisch Gmünd,

					During the early hours, the Fortress was shot down over the Netherlands by a German night fighter
					while returning from a raid on Gelsenkirchen, Germany 22Jun44. It came under attack by a
					Messerschmitt 110 piloted by Hauptmann Heinz Struning of NJG1. Although it survived the first
					attacking pass, a second two minutes later proved disastrous, knocking out the inboard starboard
					engine and rendering the aircraft's controls useless. Instructing the co-pilot to feather the engines
					the pilot then ordered the rest of the crew to stand-by for an emergency jump, but the very next
					moment the aircraft was diving out of control for the ground. Somehow by piloting skill or just
					plain luck, the pilot and co-pilot managed to pull the aircraft's nose up for just long enough so
					that the crew could bail out. While five managed to do so the pilot, co-pilot, navigator and an
					air gunner did not. Some year's later one of the survivors reportedly said that when he bailed
					out "the pilot and co-pilot were struggling with the aircraft's controls hoping to make a forced landing".
					It has never been clarified why, but the assumption is that one or more of the crew were badly
					wounded in the attack and their only chance of survival was to attempt a crash landing.
					Moments later with the aircraft in flames it crashed intohe the ground at De Aaldert, near
					Bergharen, Netherlands where it quickly burnt out. By the time anyone arrived on the scene
					four crew lay dead in the wreckage and another lay hidden beneath it. When the wreckage
					was being removed several days later, the body of the fifth member of the crew was found
					under the remains of the fuselage with an open parachute attached

					Damaged on a mission to the port area of Bremen, Germany 13Nov43 (11RTD). The pilot aborted
					from 27,000ft when the No.4 propeller oversped and could not be feathered. There were terrific
					vibrations and oil was running out. While descending, the No.4 engine caught fire at 7,000ft.
					The pilot prepared to ditch and sent out an SOS, but the fire went out in further descent. Soon after this,
					lightning struck the plane and disabled the radio. Now, with the fire out, the pilot decided to bring the
					aircraft back to base and landed safely. Failed to return from a mission to the Luftwaffe air depot at
					Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 5Dec43 (8KIA:2POW:1EVD). When the target was found to be completely
					obscured, the Group turned to its secondary target, the Luftwaffe airfield at Cognac. Finding this
					target also obscured and facing a fuel shortage, the planes began jettisoning their bomb loads.
					Meagre flak along the route intensified over target and about a dozen fighters attacked.
					Damaged by flak, dropped out of formation north of the target with No.1 propeller feathered and
					was shot down by Fw 190 fighters. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out but only three airmen
					managed to escape before the bomber crashed near Cognac, France. {11 missions}. MACR 5022 and 7325.

					Failed to return from a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 manufacturing factory at
					Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44 (6KIA:4POW). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather
					closed in over English bases and a recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air
					Commander of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division
					with greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by
					P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne
					to provide withdrawal support but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the
					bombers to fend for themselves on the return trip. It proved to be the most disastrous of the 303rd
					Bomb Group combat missions flown to date. The 303rd lost eleven of the forty B-17s flying the mission.
					Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when the American fighters returned home.
					Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run, with intermittent inaccurate flak
					on the return trip. Shot down by enemy fighters, crashed Herzberg, Sudharz, near Oschersleben,

					the SE slope of Crown Point, on a rock slope facing north on a knoll just east of the Flowers
					Trail, 28 miles west of Laporte, CO 13Jun44 (4KIS). The crew took off from Rapid City Army Air
					Base on a navigation training flight to Greeley, Colorado, Akron, Colorado and return to
					Rapid City. They proceeded to Scottsbluff, Nebraska. Upon leaving Scotts Bluff the navigator
					evidently became lost due to the pilot taking a wrong compass heading. The navigator
					had told the pilot to take a course of 197 degrees. However, the point of the crash was
					at a course of approximately 227 degrees from Scotts Bluff. They then proceeded at an altitude
					of approximately 9,600 feet. It is evident that the pilot had not checked the course flown by the
					navigator. His first realization came when he noticed he was over mountainous terrain and
					he asked for his maps. At this time he was well in the high range country and had pulled up
					to about 10,200 feet. The pilot started to check his course when they suddenly came upon
					the ridge immediately east of Crown Point. This ridge exceeds 11,500 feet. A last minute
					attempt to pull up failed. The airplane crashed and caught fire immediately. The wreck was
					demolished by the Army with dynamite six weeks after the crash.

					329th Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station), Alexandria Field, LA 1Mar45. Crashed nine
					miles WSW of Winnfield, CA 3Mar45 (11KIS). The bomber departed Alexandria Field on an
					instrument training mission to the Gum Springs Bombing Range near Winnfield. On board the
					heavy bomber was a crew of eleven men; the normal crew for a B-17 was ten men but on this
					mission a Technical Sergeant was on board giving the crew and radio operator up to date
					training on the radio systems. The bomber took off late in the day and turned toward Winnfield.
					The skies began to darken as a weather front slowly came through the area. When the bomber
					arrived over the target area, right at dusk, it flew right into the path of a cold front. The cold front
					brought forth severe thunderstorms that greatly hampered the visibility of the pilot and crew,
					with the base weather section advising of less than two miles of visibility and closing. As the
					weather turned even more for the worse, the base weather section advised the control tower at
					Alexandria Field to advise all planes flying at this time to land well in advance before the
					conditions at the airfield worsened. But due to these severe weather conditions this B-17
					experienced radio receiving and transmitting problems. Only scratchy bits and pieces of
					information were received at the base. As the weather got worse the B-17 turned due west as
					the crew tried to outrun and fly under the weather front. The B-17 dropped down in an attempt
					to get under the weather front so it could make a turn east/southeast to get back to its home
					base and flew low over two houses in the Gum Springs Community. The bomber struck a
					sixty-five foot tall pine tree, shearing off the left wing, causing the plane to crash into the ground.
					The location of the site was determined to be nine miles west/southwest of Winnfield at the
					Gum Springs Community. The Base Operations Officer led a convoy of men and equipment
					from Alexandria Field to the location in the National Forest. When arriving it was found that
					there was not an actual road into the site area. Army Engineers began building a quick road
					into the area; this road is in the National Forest and is named 'Plane Road'. Salvaged 10Mar45.

					Rammed by North American AT-6 41-361 in a simulated attack against nine B-17 bombers and
					crashed into the Gulf of Mexico off Naples at Little Marco Pass, FL 22Jan44 (10KIS). A newly rated
					pilot stationed at Buckingham Field on the southwest coast of Florida was training to be a fighter pilot.
					He took off from Naples Field (a sub-base of Buckingham) on his third flight of the day. His
					North American AT-6 41-361 was one of the aircraft scrambled to intercept a simulated attack at 4,000ft
					against nine B-17s of 715th FGTS, also based at Buckingham Field, approaching from the south over
					the Gulf of Mexico. The flight of AT-6 'fighters' successfully intercepted the B-17s and each made
					several passes at the B-17s. Following his instructor's lead the AT-6 student pilot positioned his
					plane above and behind the seventh bomber to begin his attack out of the sun. The instructor dove
					on the bomber from astern and broke to the left at about 250 yds. The student closed on the B-17
					and failed to break away and his left wing struck the left wing of the bomber. The wing of the AT-6
					sheared off, throwing the plane into a violent roll. Witnesses saw the B-17F, 42-31005, fall onto
					its left wing and slowly spiral downward. Ten seconds later at 200ft above the Gulf, the plane
					caught fire and exploded. Salvaged 23Jan44
				31006 (MSN 6120) United Air Lines, Modification Center #10, Cheyenne Municipal Airport, WY 3Sep43.
					Pilot School (Specialized, Four Engine), Hobbs Field, NM. Crashed twenty miles southwest of
					Salt Flat, TX 10May44 (5KIS). It went out of control while flying in formation, due to what is
					believed to have been a materials/mechanical failure in the oxygen system. The bomber took
					off from Hobbs Field on a routine formation training flight to El Paso, TX and then a return
					back to base. The aircraft was flying in formation at an altitude of 25,000ft. They made their
					destination of El Paso and turned for a heading to Salt Flat. The B-17 veered sharply to the right
					towards another aircraft and disappeared through the overcast layer. No further contact was
					made with any of the crew. It was thought that the aircraft had gotten into the propeller wash
					and at some point would reappear. A local rancher spotted the bomber coming straight down.
					The aircraft was said to have seemed to level off, and then head back straight down, probably
					in a stall. The eyewitness was approximately eleven miles away when he saw the aircraft hit
					the ground and catch fire. Salvaged 11May44.

					left the formation because of oxygen trouble and dropped the bombs in the vicinity of Oldenburg, Germany.
					The ball turret gunner was wounded by flak. Failed to return from a mission to the industrial areas of Emden,
					Germany 11Dec43 (6POW:4KIA). The Luftwaffe was waiting for the bombers; the moment the bombers
					crossed over into mainland Europe, six twin-engine fighter dived out of the sun upon the formation,
					concentrating all their fire on the lead plane. Once the leader had been downed, the fighters swept
					through the lead Squadron. Before the deputy lead had a chance to reassemble the formation, a large
					force of single-engine fighters joined the fray, attacking the other bombers. At the Dutch-German border,
					somewhere near Nieuwe-Schans, the bomber was hit setting fire to No.2 fuel tank. Five or six airmen
					were seen to abandon the aircraft, then something happened which still infuriates the people of the
					village of Finsterwolde. As they watched the destruction of the bomber, the German flak battery
					of the 'Steiling Dollard-Sud', in the Carel Coenraad polder, hurled shells into the helplessly
					nding fliers who had bailed out. The bomber had been partially abandoned, burned and circled
					in the sky. Then it crashed, its fuselage cartwheeling end over end. All around a house, fragments
					came down but, by some miracle, the house was untouched although the children cried for fear.
					One wing wedged itself upright in the ground. Crashed at Finsterwalde, Groningen, Netherlands.

					was leaking and the propeller could not be feathered causing the plane to drop out of formation.
					Bf 190 fighters were attacking for thirty minutes and The engineer/top turret gunner was fatally injured
					but shot down a Fw 190 while wounded. Engine No.1 was struck by cannon shells and the propeller
					couldn't be feathered either, dropping the air speed to 135mph. Confusion was rampant in the back
					of the plane. The ringing of the alarm bell twice prompted the airmen to prepare to jump.
					Co-pilot twice told the men over the intercom to disregard the bell but with all the enemy hits the
					intercom was damaged. Four other gunners had been wounded and bailed out between Ommen
					and Dalfsen, Netherlands; three evaded capture but two were later caught and taken POW. By the
					time the bomber was over the IJsselmeer it was only a hundred feet above the water.

					Attacked by enemy fighters, ditched 100 yds offshore at Calvi, Corsica. On the turn over the target area,
					two engines failed forcing the airplane to skid towards the outside of the formation. The first
					attack came from dead astern at which time the tail guns on the bomber jammed. A second fighter,
					spotting the lack of firing from the rear turret, came into point-blank range before firing, killing the
					radio operator, a waist gunner and wounding the other waist gunner also causing light wounds
					to the two other gunners. A third fighter made his pass, but the wounded gunner from his top turret
					opened fire and the fighter was seen to explode, the turret guns becoming inoperative at the time.
					A fourth fighter fell to the gunner from his ball turret and the combined work of the bombardier
					and navigator claimed another fighter destroyed. Five minutes following the attack American
					P-47 Thunderbolt fighters escorted the bomber. First aid was given the wounded, but with
					only two engines functioning, the other gunners began stripping the ship of all excess weight.
					As the pilot sighted the airfield at Calvi, Corsica, a third engine failed. Not having enough
					power and losing altitude, the pilot elected to ditch. All but the pilot and co-pilot crowded
					into the radio room, taking the dead with them. The plane hit the water approximately 100 yards
					from shore, breaking up under the impact. The airmen climbed into life rafts dragging the
					wounded but were unable to save the bodies of their dead comrades.
					The B-17 wreck is north of Calvi, at the foot of a small green lighthouse. At one time, some
					people had the idea to salvage the wreck to sell the aluminium. It was during such an operation
					that the wreck was broken. Later, a diver discovered a wallet which had belonged to one of the
					killed machine gunners. Divers cut blades off the propellers while the cockpit was destroyed by an
					anchor. In 2012 US Navy divers, assigned to Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit 2, Company 4,
					and the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, placed the American flag and the POW/MIA flag on the wreckage.
					The wreck is still down there.

					Named "Stingy" (named by Major General Frederick Anderson, CO of VIII Bomber Command,
					in honor of his son)..   While on a training mission damaged in mid-air collision with B-17G 43-37684
					11Oct44, fuselage broke in half and crashed Woodend, near Towcester, Northants (7KIS). A formation
					of B-17 Flying Fortresses took off from their base at Snetterton Heath in Norfolk, part of the 96th
					Bomb Group for a training mission with a mock bombing run above Rugby. Over the village of
					Farthingstone, before their planned turn at Silverstone to return to base, tragically a formation
					of 3 aircraft were involved in a horrific mid-air collision at 15,000ft after encountering severe
					turbulence and cloud. The accident was triggered when the pilot of B-17F 42-3510 pulled up and
					hit the nose of B-17G 43-37684 with its tail section. Just as 510 sheared in half the third B-17
					(42-31053) hit 684 with its rudder and also broke in two. Miraculously, the pilot who was piloting
					510 parachuted to safety, while his B-17 and the other bombers plummeted to earth at Woodend
					west of Towcester, in four sections. Core's four crewmen were killed as was pilot Jorgenson and his
					six man crew. Although badly damaged 43-37684 was able to limp back to Snetterton Heath. Salvaged 11Oct44.

					about 10,000ft below the formation and seemed to be under control. It followed the formation for about
					45 minutes and was then lost from sight. The collision knocked out two engines on the right wing with
					oil and gasoline all over the wing. With two engines lost, altitude could not be maintained. It was also
					apparent that the B-17 could not buck a head wind and get back to England. The pilot asked for a heading
					to fly towards the nearest Russian lines. After about an hour flying in heavy cloud cover the B-17 started to
					pick up ice on the wings and continued to lose altitude. The crew threw out guns and other heavy items

					Failed to return from a mission to the port area at Bremen, Germany 20Dec43 (7POW:3KIA).
					As the formation turned at the I.P. fighter attacks began on the low group of the lead formation.
					The bomber was heavily hit by Bf 109 fighters and began to trail behind the formation with an
					engine on fire and crewmen wounded. It was kept under control with the auto-pilot, a factor
					which would affect the plane's eventual fate, and successfully bombed the target. After the
					target the pilot cut short the turn to the rally point and came back under the formation for
					about thirty seconds. The plane was on fire, losing altitude and still under attack by enemy fighters.
					Seven crewmen were wounded and the order was given to bail out. The pilot, who had been
					flying with the auto-pilot, set the plane into a slightly nose down left hand turn. This gave
					the crew a chance to get away from the plane as they bailed out. Eight of the crew were able
					to bail out between Bremen and the village of Finna. The co-pilot, badly wounded, weak from
					loss of blood and in shock, probably passed out on the flight deck. With eight of the crew free
					of the plane, it continued to descend in a left hand turn, northwest of the target. At some point,
					two Bf 109 fighters picked up the bomber and continued to pursue it. Possibly thinking that
					the B-17 was still under control, even though two engines were by now on fire, the German pilots
					continued to make firing passes on the descending Fortress. Listed as shot down by Hptm. Alfred
					Grislawski in Fw 190A-7 of JG 1/1.  As the plane continued its auto-pilot
					controlled descent the co-pilot finally regains consciousness on the floor of the flight deck.
					He must have realized that it was very near the ground and knew that his only chance for survival
					was to get out. With some last reserve of strength he was able to attach his chest pack parachute and
					fell free from the plane at an altitude of 300 to 400 meters but is killed striking the frozen ground.

					diverted to the secondary target, a Luftwaffe airfield at Châteaubernard, Cognac, France. Flak at the
					target was moderate and accurate. Failed to return from a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190
					manufacturing factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44 (2KIA:8POW). While the aircraft were
					airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and a recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis,
					Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division
					with greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts
					on the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal
					support but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for
					themselves on the return trip. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when the
					American fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run,
					with intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. Trouble began during severe enemy fighter
					attacks about twenty minutes prior to the target. 20mm cannon shells started a small fire in the left wing.
					The fire remained quite small until after the target, when the formation lowered altitude by about 2000 feet.
					Then the fire enlarged, probably due to increase in the atmosphere's oxygen supply. Enemy aircraft then
					scored more hits and the flight controls became sluggish. At that time the engineer was probably killed.
					The crew began to bail out at about 1500 feet and six men bailed out successfully. Three more crew
					members were preparing to bail via the nose hatch when the plane exploded in the air. The pilot and
					bombardier were blown clear, but apparently the co-pilot was blown further back into the plane and
					did not survive the crash. The plane crashed at Schmede, south of Steinfeld, Germany. {18 missions}.

					a mission to the industrial areas of Emden, Germany 11Dec43 (10POW). The Luftwaffe was waiting for
					the bombers; the moment the bombers crossed over into mainland Europe, six twin-engine fighters
					dived out of the sun upon the formation, concentrating all their fire on the lead plane. Once the leader
					had been downed, the fighters swept through the lead Squadron. Before the deputy lead had a chance
					to reassemble the formation, a large force of single-engine fighters joined the fray, attacking the
					other bombers. The plane received a direct flak hit on the No.2 engine, which knocked it off the wing and
					the plane out of the formation. The No.I engine was so badly damaged that the pilot had to feather the propeller.
					The No.3 engine started losing oil in a steady stream. The plane dropped off to the starboard side and
					lost about 2,000ft altitude before recovering to fairly level flight. By this time the plane was dropping
					farther behind the group. A flak burst pulverized the glass on the left side of the pilot's compartment
					After the bombs were jettisoned the pilot turned toward the west. He pushed the throttle for No.4 engine
					as far forward as it could go then used No.3 engine intermittently because after running a while it would
					overheat and he had to let it idle to cool down. At that time the pilot learned that the navigator had bailed out.
					During the flight across the Netherlands, the pilot explained to the crew that he did not know if he had
					power enough to get them back to England on the one engine. The plane continued on its way and crossed the
					northern end of the Netherlands and passed between two of the islands off the coast. A few minutes later,
					the pilot tried to get some help from the No.3 engine whi ch had cooled down, but as the engine RPMs
					increased it started to ignite (it had probably lost too much oil) so there was only one thing left to do - ditch.
					The plane had descended to I,500 feet at that point so the crew prepared for ditching. The bomber was
					ditched in the North Sea off Texel island, Netherlands. The crew was rescued by a German naval vessel.

					was the oldest man on the crew; the rest of the crew, being much younger, looked up to the 'old man'
					who had a calming influence on them.Damaged during a mission to the port at Bremen,
					Germany 26Nov43 (1WIA). The aircraft was thrown upward when hit by flak and a large hole
					appeared in the right wing. There was a sound of more flak bursts and more holes appeared.
					A green burst of flak appeared and enemy fighters attacked the formation. The bombardier called
					out two Bf 109s at 12 o'clock and then called on the interphone saying in a calm voice that he was hit,
					and that the navigator was taking care of him. The navigator had stopped the bleeding with a large
					gauze pad and bound his wound. The bombardier had been hit in the right knee taking off the patella.
					The pain was intense, but he carefully took off his helmet and goggles, and put on his army cap before
					allowing the medics to carry him out. The aircraft had 53 good-sized flak holes in it, mostly in the
					right wing. The right wing had to be replaced keeping the plane on the ground for several days.
					The engineer traced the path of the bullet that struck the bombardier from the nose compartment
					through the fuselage. He found the copper jacket of the armor-piercing bullet in the crawl way

					concentrating all their fire on the lead plane. Once the leader had been downed, the fighters swept through the
					lead Squadron. Before the deputy lead had a chance to reassemble the formation, a large force of single-engine
					fighters joined the fray, attacking the other bombers. On the return leg of the flight, just over the Dutch border,
					the aircraft was struck by flak and No.3 engine damaged and stopped. The propeller on this engine could not be
					feathered so windmilled which vibrated the aircraft severely. No.1 engine was then damaged and further flak
					damage sustained to the bomb bay doors and nose of the aircraft. It was also attacked by enemy fighters
					causing damage to the bomber. The aircraft began to lose height and, believing that control was going to be lost,
					the pilot ordered the crew to bale out over what they thought was the land part of the Netherlands but by the
					time they started to abandon the aircraft they were over the coast. The aircraft appears to have been still at
					altitude, probably around 18,000ft when the crew started to bail out. In total eight of the ten on board bailed out
					with six of the eight drowning. The two survivors who bailed out appear to have delayed pulling their parachute
					release until much lower than the height the aircraft was flying at; these two landed much closer to land and
					 were rescued by Dutch lifeboat 'Twenthe' but then became POWs. The six others who bailed out appear to have
					drifted some distance out to sea and sadly all drowned with the bodies of some taking many months to drift
					to shore while others were never found. After these first eight had left the aircraft the next who was about
					to leave was the bombardier but he had struggled to fit his parachute alone so the pilot had put the aircraft
					on auto-pilot and was attempting to help secure the straps. Before the bombardier could leave the aircraft the
					windmilling propeller then seized and the vibrating stopped so the two still on board stayed with the aircraft
					and opted to try and fly it back to England. The aircraft eventually landed at Lindholme airfield in Yorkshire
					and was subsequently repaired. MACR 8711.  Plane repaired.  Crash landed at RAF Woodbridge
					emergency landing airfield, Suffolk 30Jan44. Took off as a spare for a mission to Watten, France 26Mar44,

					All of a sudden, however, it snapped roll all the way over and began to go down in a flat backward spin.
					In the cockpit, the pilots were struggling to pull the aircraft out. However, still with the full
					bomb load and more than half of the fuel load on board, it cannot stand the strain and shortly
					before plunging into the overcast at about 20,000ft, it finally broke in two, the break occurring
					exactly in the middle of the radio room. The bombardier was thrown headlong through the
					Plexiglas nose without his parachute and the radio operator, also without a parachute, fell out
					of the radio room, now open at one end. The two pilots and engineer were trapped by centrifugal
					force and unable to escape. On its way down, the plane lost one engine, one outer wing as
					well as several bombs, the majority of which, however, did not explode. Tearing across
					the school furniture factory of Grauer & Co. in the direction of the Weschnitz creek, it finally
					crashed on the property boundary between the gardens behind the furniture dealer Eidt, 89 Bergstrasse,
					and the barber shop Kussmaul, 87 Bergstrasse. One outer wing landed precisely where
					Gunterstrasse finishes and Rottensteiner Weg starts off. Another one came down just in front
					of the fence of the factory acres of Freudenberg company, off the end of Karlstrasse. One of the
					engines fell between the railway siding of Freudenberg company and the fence of the factory.
					A second one crashed on the area of Grauer company, causing one shed at the corner of
					Hopfenstrasse and Altelandstrasse to burn down. A third engine including the propeller dug
					into the estate of the Jaeger family, 86 Bergstrasse. A fuel tank came down in the garden of
					80 Bergstrasse. In Roemerstrasse and Neckarstrasse as well as along the railway line leading
					up to Darmstadt, a total of nine or ten bombs came down but did not explode. Another one
					landed in the garden of 76 Bergstrasse; this one exploded. Immediately after the crash of the
					main part, fire started on the wreck which was lying on the ground with the right side of the
					fuselage down. The rear section went spinning down, with its heavy ball turret first, towards
					Birkenau crashing on the hillside above a residential house at Am Schönherrnberg, where it
					immediately slid down hill into the rear of this building. The occupant believed a bomb had
					struck and fled with her three children out of the opposite side of the house into the road.
					Crashed at Weinheim and Birkenau, twelve miles northeast of Mannheim, Germany. {8 missions)

					crossing the enemy coast at IJmuiden, Netherlands. In the vicinity of Lingen, Germany the formation
					was attacked by enemy fighters in groups of three. As they neared the target, twin-engined aircraft
					fired rockets into the formation. Intense flak was encountered at the target where the aircraft

					{first combat mission 20Feb44}. The aircraft took off as spare for a mission 24Mar44. No.2
					engine started leaking oil and the pressure dropped causing some difficulty in feathering the propeller.
					The pilot turned back towards base and made a let down through heavy cloud cover. Then No.3 engine
					started to cut out and finally stopped, causing the bomber to lose altitude rapidly. Breaking out of
					cloud at 500 feet the pilot spotted an airfield and made a turn to line up with the runway.
					Despite calling the control tower, the controller didn't reply. Approaching to land, the tower
					then told the pilot to circle for three minutes as P-38 Lightning fighters were taking off. By now
					at 30 feet above the ground, the bomber started pulling up for a go-around but, with only two
					engines operating and a full fuel and bomb load, the aircraft was unable to exceed sixty feet altitude.
					With trees ahead, the pilot made a right turn towards an open field. Losing height, the landing gear

					Departing on a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical works at Leverkusen, Germany 1Dec43, during
					initial climb in wing formation, the low squadron was forced to fly through a cloud layer with
					icing conditions. With ¾ inch of ice on the wing, this caused the aircraft to stall, spin and fall

					mission to a V-2 rocket service bunker complex at Sottevast, Normandy, France 8May44
					(5KIA:4POW:1EVD). On the bomb run, the aircraft took a direct flak hit in the cockpit and mid
					section and lost altitude rapidly. The crew at the front of the bomber were probably injured or

					Failed to return from a mission to the Junkers aircraft plant and airfield at Halberstadt, Germany 30May44
					(5POW:4KIA). As the formation crossed the Dutch coast No.2 engine started to smoke which caused it to
					drop back from its No.2 position to the No.6 position of the low squadron. After dropping its bombs
					the smoke from the ?. 2 engine worsened and the propeller was subsequently feathered. From
					this moment on the bomber progressively dropped behind the formation. On the second bomb
					run the aircraft could not make the turn and lagged behind the formation. It was last seen near
					Nordhausen. The aircraft was then attacked by German Bf 109's after which the pilot ordered the
					crew to bail out. All of the crew bailed out of the aircraft in quick succession after being ordered to
					abandon the aircraft. The pilot remained with the crippled aircraft for some 5 to 8 minutes and flew

					down. Smoke was coming from the engine. By this time the aircraft was almost at the German border
					and the crew started to abort and return to base. Then the bomber began to vibrate and shook bad.
					The pilot gave the order "prepare to abandon ship". He told the bombardier and navigator to get out
					of the nose. Later the engine started to act up again. Again the order came over the interphone, "prepare to jump".
					The pilot got ready to jump and he gave the signal and was just ready to give the order to jump when the
					propeller came off and the aircraft stopped vibrating. Then the order came "prepare to ditch".
					But the bomber made it back to base. Nineteen holes were found in the front portion of the bomber;
					all these were from debris flying off the engine. The engine cowlings had been shaken off and the
					engine mounts damaged. The engine and propeller were replaced and the bomber was back on operations

					The crew was rescued by British Air-Sea Rescue launch and taken to Manston. {1 mission}.
				 	The remains of the B-17 Flying Fortress lie on the Sandwich Flats. The crash site lay undisturbed
					until 1999 when two incidents took place that left the Flying Fortress looking like a demolished wreck.
					A British recovery team discovered the ditched B-17 in the 1990s in the marsh land at Sandwich Flats
					near Pegwell Bay and were able to collect wreckage that was turned over to the Brenzett Aeronautical
					Museum, Romney Marsh, Kent. Other relics are on display at the RAF Manston History Museum.
					This was followed by an excavation that removed more items leaving just the wings, two engines
					and part of the frame in the fuselage area. Since 1999 the site has been covered and uncovered by
					sand on many occasions, often with just a lone propeller sticking out of the sand. During the winter
					of 2015/2016 the site was uncovered yet again but this time wreckage appeared on the foreshore
					as it was evident the wings were breaking up. It was exposed on an extremely low tide 13Feb16.
					Both wings were present and the second engine nacelle was intact with a damaged propeller, a 'Tokyo'
					fuel tank visible in a wing and in excellent condition. There is also a field of debris around the wreck site.

					were made, on which there were a great many. Those notes were written by citizens of Philadelphia,
					allegedly, hoping that 'their' bomber would triumph and return home when war finally ended.
					During formation as an air spare on a mission to the Mitteldeutsche Motorenwerke aero engine
					factory at Taucha, Leipzig, Germany 7Jul44 the bomber was damaged by debris from a mid-air
					collision between B-17G 42-102442 and 44-6147 near Haverhill, Essex. The bomber was showered
					with incendiary sticks, one lodged into the skin of the left wing, punching into one of the fuel tanks.
					The aircraft returned to Chelveston, landing with what the crew believed was a live incendiary
					stick protruding out of the wing and tank full of fuel. Severely battle damaged on a mission to the
					Merkwiller Oil Refinery, France 3Aug44 (7KIA). Crashed at Wymington, near Rushden, Northants.
					The bomber was crippled from anti aircraft fire suffered over Kaiserslautern en route to the target.
					It later suffered a number of fighter attacks over the target but managed to keep formation on three
					engines. As the aircraft crossed the east coast of England, a second engine began to falter and
					was reduced in power, a third bearly ticking over. On approach to the airfield, another B-17 with
					wounded crew aboard shot a flare and took priority for landing, forcing the bomber to go around
					for a second approach. At that moment one of the two remaining good engines began to red line
					and overheat, eventually catching fire. The two pilots pushed the throttle on the third engine,
					and attempted to restart the dead engine. At less than 200 feet the B-17 banked over the village of
					Wymington, turning around the cottages and houses below. It had dropped level with the village
					church steeple, just 125 feet high, forcing the plane to skim to one side to avoid hitting it.
					In an amazing feat of airmanship, the pilots brought the plane back into level flight, just 60 feet
					above the ground and just clearing the thatched roofs below. Witnesses saw, heard and felt the
					plane as it passed overhead, shaking tea cups and plates on kitchen dressers as she headed over
					the village and back towards Chelveston. In the last seconds, with one engine ablaze, two almost
					at a stop, the bomber struck one of several tall Elm trees. The impact caused an explosion, the plane
					pancaked into a field right beside the High Street, by a miracle avoiding hitting the Manor Farm House
					and several cottages in that part of the village. {65 missions}. Salvaged 10Aug44.

					Accident landing from an aborted mission to Berlin, Germany 22Mar44 (10RTD). The pilot aborted

					caught in a ditch at the end. Crashed early morning on takeoff for a mission to the industrial
					area at Brunswick, Germany 26Apr44 (10RTD). As the aircraft reached normal takeoff speed, about ¾
					way down the runway, it was in an extreme tail high attitude. The pilot adjusted the elevator
					trim to more than required for a normal takeoff. Both pilots pulled back on the elevator but the
					aircraft failed to gain more than a few feet of altitude before the pilot chopped the throttles.
					The aircraft touched down after it had passed the end of the runway, struck a wooden fence,
					crashed through three hedges and over three ditches, each about four feet deep, and skidded
					across a fairly level wheat field and came to rest one mile from the end of the runway at
					Great Ellingham, Norfolk. It was later determined that the stabiliser had malfunctioned. Salvaged

					airfield at Ålborg, Denmark 23Feb44 (10KIA). Enemy fighters attacked the B-17 overhead the target, and
					pursued the bomber as the bombardier, aware of the Danish civilians below, was unable to release the
					bombs due to cloud cover obscuring the target. The aircraft was badly damaged by the attacking fighters.
					Bombs were released harmlessly over the North Sea as the B-17 limped back towards base in Northamptonshire.
					It is probable the navigation and communication equipment was out of service, and that some of the crew
					were dead or wounded from the attack. For whatever reasons, the bomber ended up eighty miles off
					course and circling low over the city of Sheffield. In Endcliffe Park, kids playing football watched as an
					engine finally cut, a wing dipped and the aircraft spiralled down into a wooded knoll next to the playing field.
					Crashed at Endcliffe Park, Sheffield, Yorkshire. It is probable that the pilot was considering a crash landing
					on the grass playing field so the children ran off into the woods. This might also account for why some of the
					crew at least didn't bail out. The pilot missed hitting the children but then had to avoid a mock Tudor
					pavilion that today is a busy café in the park. The aircraft nearly ended up on top of the children that
					had run out of its path; only the Porter Brook stream acting as a barrier to the childrens' escape
					prevented further tragedy. Salvaged 25Feb44 by 2nd Strategic Air Depot, Abbots Ripton (Station 547), Huntingdonshire.

					were still in training in Pyote Field, TX they would often enjoy a late night of drinking and dancing
					at a hall and beer parlor at the small town of Monahans. One pilot would often have trouble getting
					his co-pilot out of bed the next morning. On one particular morning the pliot was trying to get his
					co-pilot to wake up and the co-pilot blew in his face. The pilot replied something like "Man, you have
					dog breath!" He then paused for a bit and said "That's what we are going to name our plane", and they did.
					Battle damaged on return from a mission 26Mar44 (1KIA). Failed to return from a mission to a Luftwaffe
					airfield at Corme-Écluse, east of Royan, France 19Jun44 (10INT). The Group went over the secondary target
					twice and the plane was last seen heading down the Gironde estuary after dropping out of formation.
					It appeared to be under control although flak struck No.1 engine, then No.2 engine failed with an oil leak.

					Named. MON TETE ROUGE / TINA TANGERINE [This plane was named by its original pilot Harold G. "Hal" Fulmer.
					His wife had sort of reddish hair and had some French ancestry in her, so he came up with the French name "
					"Mon Tête Rouge", which is translated to "My Red Head". Fulmer later found out that "Mon" in French is
					actually the masculine word instead of the feminine word "Ma". It was already painted on the plane,
					so he left it as it was. This plane was an olive drab plane with a red-headed lady painted on her knees
					and slightly leaning backward. Some historians have incorrectly also called this plane "Tangerine"
					because another pilot named Glenn T. Butterworth was flying "Mon Tete Rouge" when he was shot down
					with it. It was incorrectly assumed that the lost plane was "Tangerine"]   . Failed to return from a mission
					to the Vereinigte Kugellagerfabriken AG (VKF) ball bearing factory at Erkner, Berlin, Germany 8Mar44 (1KIA:9POW).
					All the way from the Netherlands to Berlin, the bombers were hounded by Luftwaffe fighters. Prior to the target,
					enemy fighter aircraft damaged engine No.3 and a supercharger on another engine. The plane dropped
					out of formation and jettisoned the bombs. It returned towards England at low level to avoid detection
					but then four enemy fighters attacked. 20mm cannon shells penetrated the cockpit and exploded,
					setting the plane on fire and killing the bombardier. With the bomb bay on fire, the pilot crash landed
					on the left bank of River Weser, near Nienburg, Germany.  MACR 3190

					Luftwaffe air depot at Mérignac, Bordeaux, France 31Dec43. The target was covered in solid cloud
					so the group diverted to the secondary target, a Luftwaffe airfield at Châteaubernard, Cognac, France.
					Flak at the target was moderate and accurate. Battle damaged on a mission to the Kriegsmarinewerft
					shipyard at Wilhelmshaven, Germany 3Feb44 (1WIA:9RTD). Struck by flak wounding the top turret
					gunner. Battle damaged on a mission to the Junkers Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory at Aschersleben,
					Germany 22Feb44 (10RTD). On the way to the target, the formation met with the 381st Bomb Group.
					Since these planes were late following the main formation, no escort was available. Heavy cloud
					cover over the target forced the formation to divert to the industrial area of Bünde, Germany.
					The bomber formation was exposed to the attack of German fighters for over forty minutes without
					interruption, most of which were Fw 190s. When the fighter attacks started, the bomber took several
					hits head on, No.3 engine was disabled, the propeller was feathered and the bombs jettisoned.
					No.4 engine was damaged but still running. An empty machine gun casing from a fighter crashed
					through the Plexiglas nose and a bullet put a hole in the right tailplane. With only three engines
					running the plane dropped out of formation and made an effort to join some other planes for better
					protection. The plane's speed blew out the fire in No.3 engine just as the pilot maneuvered in a good
					protective spot among another formation. The pilot stayed with formation over the target and most
					of the way back but dropped behind when nearing the North Sea as he did not want to chance
					burning up the remaining engines after getting so near home. Upon landing at Bassingbourn the
					hydraulic unit on the landing gear failed so the pilot ran the plane off the runway and onto the
					grass where it finally rolled to a stop. Major battle damage on a mission to Friedrichstrasse
					railway station, Berlin, Germany 7May44. Battle damage on a mission to the Heinkel Flugzeugwerke
					aircraft factory at Oranienburg, Germany 22Mar44. Just east of Hamburg en route to the target,
					the pilot had to feather the propeller on No.1 engine because of mechanical failures. Unable to
					continue to Berlin on three engines, the pilot decided to turn back and try to make the trip back alone.
					After turning the bombardier dropped the bombs in the Hamburg area. When it landed the plane
					had one flak hole in the bomb bay and one in the fuel tank under the wing. The piece of flak went
					through the wing and the three thickness automatic sealing fuel tank. Battle damaged on a mission
					to a Luftwaffe airfield at Oldenburg, Germany 8Apr44. The 91st Bomb Group was the last group
					over the target and took very heavy flak. Failed to return from a mission to an oil storage depot
					at Derben, Germany 8Apr45 (8KIA:1POW). With solid cloud cover, the group diverted to the secondary
					target, locomotive repair facilities at Stendal, Germany. The Germans had moved two railcar
					mounted 88mm Flak guns into Stendal the night before the raid; the soldiers had manned anti-aircraft
					guns the entire war and were skilled marksmen. The bomber received a direct flak hit approximately
					between the bomb-bay and the No.2 engine on the left wing. The aircraft immediately started into a
					vertical dive. The fuselage was on fire and when it had dropped approximately 5,000ft the left wing
					fell off. It continued down and when the fuselage was about 3,000ft from the ground it exploded,
					and then exploded again when it hit the ground near Stendal. {129 missions}. MACR 13881

					Accident departing for a mission to an industrial area at Leipzig, Germany 12Apr44 (6KIA:4RTD).
					During assembly the bombers were having problems holding position in a tight formation
					caused by differences in wind speed between the different altitudes of the squadrons. During a turn,
					this plane, being on the inside of the turn, had to slow down and it stalled. The pilot attempted
					to maintain altitude to allow other planes to fly out from under it. The plane then fell off into a
					violent spin but, when attempting to stop the spinning, it tore apart at the ball turret section.
					The front section made a violent turn onto its back, tearing off the upper turret and ejecting
					the gunner, then started rotating like a maple leaf allowing the co-pilot to escape. The wreckage
					fell into the North Sea, off Clacton, Essex. The co-pilot was rescued within minutes by a

					near Lonlay-l'Abbaye, France. {60 missions}  .MACR 8079  .
					On August 8, 1944, the bomber was flying over Normandy, occupied France, and was ten minutes from
					its target when it was hit by anti-aircraft flak. The bomber broke apart in the sky and the fuselage
					landed in a farmer's field in Lonlay-l'Abbaye, approximately 65km southwest of Caen. One of the
					wings landed in an adjacent farm field belonging to Mr. Pierre Lehec and remained there until 2011
					being used to protect firewood. Three crewmembers were not found and were listed as missing in
					action until 2004. ?The landowner, believing the search for the missing was over, collected the
					debris from the crash and buried it in the largest crater caused by the crash. The hole was filled
					and covered with fresh soil. The land continued to be used as a cattle farm for six decades.
					In June of 2004 a Department of Defense team began work on the crash site. The remains of the
					three missing crew members were recovered from the crash site. The site also contained two engines
					from the plane, parts of the wings, a portion of the nose art and a 0.50-caliber machine gun.
					The "Chow-hound" was identified by the serial number on the machine gun. There were also six,
					250 pound, live bombs. The nose art recovered during the excavation shows part of the dog
					and Tony Starcer's signature. In 2008, family members of the Thompson crew began efforts to
					retrieve the "Chow-hound" wing, which has been on the farm since the crash. Those efforts
					culminated three years later when approximately forty airmen from the 514th Air Mobility
					Wing (Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J.) flew to Caen, France on September 23, 2011,
					to retrieve the wreckage of the "Chow-hound". L'ANSA Orne Maine (Association Normande du
					Souvenir Aérien) delivered the wing to Caen Airport where it was loaded into a Boeing C-17
					Globemaster. Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) in New Jersey dedicated a memorial
					to the Thompson Crew of the "Chow-hound" August 8, 2015. The "Chow-hound" wing is the

					rammed by a Bf 109, crashed Hoerdum, 12 miles southwest of Thisted, Jutland, Denmark.
					The aircraft took off to bomb Aalborg West air base. The main purpose was to draw German
					fighters away from targets in Germany which would be attacked by other American forces.
					The bombers arrived over Aalborg but were not able to drop their bomb load due to heavy
					overcast, and they set course back towards west. When they were back over the North Sea
					they were attacked by German fighters from 11./JG 11 and 10./NJG 3. The bomber was
					attacked by Oberleutnant Hans Müller of 10./NJG 3 flying Ju-88C-6 D5+AV and severely damaged.
					The right wing fuel tank was on fire. The pilot turned back towards land since it would mean
					certain death to bail out over the cold North Sea. He lowered the landing gear to show the Ju- 88
					that he had given up and was followed back towards the coast by the fighter. Despite the wing
					on fire, the Germans thought the bomber crew might try to reach Sweden and Müller was
					ordered to shoot the bomber down. He stopped firing when he saw the crew bail out.
					Upon reaching land the crew bailed out of the B-17 and it crashed to the ground in a field
					two kilometres west of Hørdum.  MACR 2750

					closed in over English bases and a recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander
					of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater
					exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the
					penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal
					support but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for themselves
					on the return trip. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when the American
					fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run, with
					intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. Damaged by flak, one of the four engines was disabled
					and the pilot was having difficulty maintain formation. As a result, the aircraft deviated far south
					of the planned route. After ditching in the Bay of Biscay west of Penhors, around two miles off the

					Failed to return from a mission to the harbor at Piraeus, Greece 11Jan44 (10KIA), mid-air collision,
					crashed Patri, Greece. On that fateful day, the briefed mission was for the 5th Wing composed of the
					2nd, 97th, 301st and 99th Bomb Groups, to fly on a southerly course through the heel of Italy to the
					town of Lecce where the Wing would then take a heading out over the Adriatic Sea, to a point over
					the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece. From this point the crews were briefed to complete a 90° degree
					turn to the Initial Point over Lagousa Island. From there the mission dictated a straight run in
					to the target, reassemble, and return to base. After the formation was organized and began
					making its way to the target, the Groups ran into a weather front of 10/10 clouds. At eighteen
					thousand feet they entered an overcast. The clouds were very thick and visibility was not
					much beyond the wingtips, making it almost impossible to see other aircraft in the formation.
					At that altitude, and with the thickness of the clouds, ice began to form on their wings.
					In such situations it was standard operating procedure for trailing squadrons in the formation
					to fly off course for a couple minutes to obtain some spacing from the lead squadron, which
					would continue to maintain its course. However, as the 97th Bomb Group began making a left
					turn for their bomb run on the target, the lead bomber of the 342nd Bomb Squadron
					encountered severe turbulence made by the preceding elements of the Wing. The turbulence
					was so severe that the lead aircraft of the squadron was forced into a steep left bank before it
					plummeted temporarily out of control and lost altitude at a rate of 1,000ft per minute.
					By the time the pilot was able to recover and regain his place in formation, his two sister
					bombers in the flight were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the pilots of the two sister bombers
					from the flight, B-17F No.42-3251 and B-17F No.42-29918 found themselves alone in 10/10 visibility,
					unsure where the formation had disappeared to, with ice forming on their wings, and experiencing
					engine trouble. From what was deduced later in the accident report, the doomed B-17s made
					the decision to abort and turn back for the relative safety of Italy. In a tragic turn of events, their
					decision to return home took them directly into the path of the oncoming 301st Bomb Group.
					According to the official report of the Board of Inquiry, the two B-17s of the 97th Bomb Group
					experienced engine trouble and left the formation. Instead of making a 180-degree right turn,
					away from the formation, the aircraft made a turn to the left and flew head-on into the
					301st formation. According to a Bombardier assigned to the lead bomber of the 301st Bomb Group,
					and flown by the Group Commanding Officer, he was startled to see a pair of 97th Bomb Group B-17s
					emerge out of a cloud about 20 degrees to the left and aimed straight at his aircraft. Almost
					instantly, both B-17s bracketed his aircraft, with one passing closely over his right wing that
					clipped the vertical stabiliser, and the other closely passing beneath the left wing. Almost immediately,
					the tail gunner witnessed a big ball of fire that lit up the clouds as the B-17s collided with one
					Fortress in the lead element, and two B-17s in the second element. P-38 pilots, flying low cover
					escort under the overcast, reported watching pieces of B-17s raining from the sky for what seemed
					like five minutes. There were eight B-17s that fell out of the sky simultaneously. Thirteen Americans
					survived; 64 perished. {4 missions}.  MACR 1833

					shot out the number four engine. The pilot had trouble feathering one of the two propellers
					after the number three engine failed. The plane continued on the bomb run and released the bombs.
					While losing altitude, the pilot ordered the crew to jettison all unnecessary equipment. They tried to
					jettisoned the ball turret and even shot the mountings with their.45-caliber pistols to no avail.
					In all the excitement the crew threw out several parachutes. This meant their only option was to
					ditch in the Adriatic Sea. By this time the plane was at about 500 feet, and the pilot was able to r
					egain level flight. The full power of the port engine was enough to just exceed stalling speed.
					At about five miles from the coast, the number two engine blew up, forcing the pilot to ditch off
					Pescara, Italy. It was a rough ditching and the crew had to swim to reach the life rafts.

					With bad weather, the Group changed for the secondary target at Udine, Italy. During the bomb run,
					flak hit No.1, 2 and 4 engines, the left wing tip and tail, and there was smoke in the radio room.
					No.1 propeller was feathered but could not feather No.4 propeller, the engine was losing oil
					and smoking. No.2 engine was still running normally despite visible damage with a large hole
					underneath. The pilot ordered the crew to standby to abandon the aircraft and the bombardier
					jettisoned the bombs. Losing height, the plane was in a gradual turn heading out to sea and
					still under control. The crew prepared for a ditching incase No.4 engine caught fire.
					No.2 engine now started to lose oil pressure and quit south of Ancona. The pilot ditched
					the bomber in the Adriatic Sea about twenty miles off Ancona, Italy. With its back broken
					and nose down at a steep angle, the aircraft remained afloat for about five minutes.
					The survivors in a life raft attempted to row towards shore but the sea was too rough. Despite seeing
					friendly aircraft, they were unable to attract attention and remained afloat all night.
					The following morning they were spotted by an enemy Me 210. Next a flight of Me 210s was
					spotted passing by followed shortly afterwards by a flight of P-38 Lightnings.
					Still not seen, the P-38s eventually turned back and one of the pilots finally spotted
					the life raft. With fighter protection, a Royal Air Force Air-Sea Rescue Supermarine

					accurate flak just turning off the I.P. when the tail gunner was wounded by shrapnel.
					Battle damaged during a tactical mission against German troop concentrations and defensive
					positions at Albano Laziale, southeast of Rome, Italy 10Feb44 (1KIA:9RTD). Flak, both heavy and light type,
					was intense and accurate due to the low bombing altitude necessary to get under an undercast.
					Shrapnel killed the tail gunner. Failed to return from a mission to the railway marshalling yards at
					Padua, Italy 11Mar44 (1KIA:9EVD). A group of lower flying B-24 Liberators on a different axis
					of attack caused the planes of the 2ndBG to abort the run and make a 360 to the right for a
					second bomb run at the target. This gave time for enemy fighters to assemble for an attack
					on the bombers. Attacked by enemy fighters, the number one engine was disabled, number
					two had some damage, the right aileron was shot away and the interphone was dead.
					None of the crew was injured prior to bail out. The tail gunner bailed out near Pirovac
					but was killed when his parachute failed. The plane crashed near Vibenik, Croatia, Yugoslavia.

					irfield at Essey, Nancy, France 27Apr44. No.3 engine disabled by flak before reaching the I.P.
					en route to the target. Seriously battle damaged on a mission to railway facilities around
					Berlin, Germany 29Apr44. A piece of flak shrapnel came in from the left and tore a hole
					in the tail gunner's heated suit. The plane received a lot of damage to the left wing and it
					caused a loss of hydraulic fluid so that when it landed it had no brakes. The pilot knew
					he wouldn't be able to stop before running off the end of the runway. So as soon as the
					plane slowed enough, the pilot ran off the side of the runway into the grass, to slow it down.
					It worked, and it stopped just short of the end of the runway. When the crew got out of the
					plane and were collecting their equipment about twelve feet of the right wing creaked and
					groaned and slowly drooped down onto the ground. Later inspection showed that the plane flew
					back from Berlin with only one inch of the main wing spar intact. Seriously battle damaged
					on a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Liège, Belgium 31May44 (1KIA:2WIA:7RTD). Struck by
					flak over the target, an Eighth Air Force photographer was killed by shrapnel. The No.4 engine
					oil cooler was damaged and leaked preventing the propeller being feathered. The windmilling
					propeller caused the plane to lag behind the formation and the engine caught fire. This caused
					severe vibration of the airframe but eventually the fire extinguished and the plane was escorted
					by P-47 Thunderbolts back to the safety of the English Channel. On landing at base, the propeller
					flew out, clearing away some spectators. Loaned to Royal Air Force 8Jan45. Returned to
					USAAF 5Mar45. 423rd Bomb Squadron [RD*Y], 306th Bomb Group, Thurleigh (Station 111),
					Bedfordshire 5Mar45. During a night training flight, the pilot made a normal approach for a
					touch-and-go landing at Thurleigh 15Mar45. The plane appeared to bounce then the pilot
					applied throttle for going around. He advised the tower that the landing gear struts were
					broken and was instructed to land on the alternate runway. Touching down, the landing gear
					slowly collapsed and allowed the plane to ground loop off the runway. Salvaged, non battle damage

					Air Service Command, Ridgewell Feb44. This aircraft was a B-17G with the new Bendix
					chin turret when it first arrived on the station, and after a few missions it ended up on its
					belly and the Sub-Depot `inherited it'. At the time, parts for chin turrets were practically
					non-existent and the turret on `448 needed parts. In order to return the aircraft to operations
					as soon as possible, it was decided to close up the hole left by the chin turret and install
					flexible nose guns, such as the B-17F had. These changes gave the bomber the outward
					appearance of a B-17F rather than a G. Inasmuch as the aircraft's number was '448, the
					Sub-Depot asked for and received permission to name and decorate the bomber.
					It was appropriately named the `Halfbreed' and was decorated with a halfbreed Indian
					warrior holding a bomb ticketed for Berlin. The Indian had the old squadron insignia

					parts of the Austrian Alps and then turned 180° and from the north launched the attack on Udine.
					This plane was flying in the rear four plane element. When thirty minutes from the target the group
					was attacked by German Fw 190 fighters and in the ensuing scramble to close up, the element became
					separated from the rest of the group and squadron. As a result, the fighters concentrated their attacks

					It was a disastrous day for the 2nd Bomb Group, losing nine B-17s in a onesided, nineteen-minute
					attack by the Luftwaffe on the way to the target; the 20th Bomb Squadron lost all seven of its aircraft
					to enemy fighters. It was the second greatest, one day, aircraft loss for the Group but one with the
					greatest loss of life. German fighters shot at the rear of the plane and killed the ball turret gunner;
					rear gunner was badly injured. A cannon shell that exploded made a big hole in the fuselage and
					killed the radio operator, who was at the time shooting from the upper turret, and both side gunners.
					The stabilisers were also hit, and the plane, with three engines on fire, quickly dropped. Another
					cannon shell ignited the flight compartment. The explosion stunned the flight engineer who fell to
					the floor of the flight compartment unconscious. The bombardier tried in vain to jettison the bombs.
					The pilot held the airplane in the air to give the others a chance to escape. The fire in the bomb bay
					released the jammed mechanism and the bombs left the plane, which suddenly fell into a spin
					and dropped out of the sky. In the last few seconds, the pilot was able to pin the parachute to the

					Group, Thurleigh (Station 111), Bedfordshire 23Sep44. Named "Elizabeth".  Accident during a mission
					to an oil refinery at Dortmund, Germany 7Mar45 (8RTD). Near Dortmund, one of the group dropped
					out of formation and the pilot of B-17G 44-6807 moved up to fill the box. During the manoeuvre
					the pilot of this plane nosed down and the No.1 propeller chewed into the tail section of 44-6807.
					That knocked off its right horizontal stabiliser and elevator as well as the tail turret, killing the gunner.
					The pilot of that plane dropped out of formation and turned back towards Allied lines. The
					propeller of this plane was knocked off and the engine oversped before being shut down. This
					plane continued to drop bombs on the target and remained with the group until reaching the
					English coast when it headed alone to land safely back at base. Accident landing at Thurleigh 16Apr45.
					Without hydraulic pressure the plane landed about a third way down the runway, ran off the side,

					after a training flight at Bassingbourn 5Apr44 (6RTD). A pilot had returned to duty and was
					to be shown the type of low-level flying the Group had been practicing while he was in hospital.
					Three Army officers were also going for a ride in a B-17. Once aloft, the pilots buzzed the control towers
					of a couple of other nearby air bases. Returning to Bassingbourn, as the plane approached the runway,
					the pilot extended the tail wheel, and as some of the new aircraft were having trouble locking the tail
					wheel, it became necessary for the flight engineer to go back through the bomb bay and waist sections
					to check that the tail wheel was locked before landing. Returning to the cockpit, he closed the door
					between the cockpit and the bomb bay. All being OK, the pilot lowered the flaps, followed by
					lowering the main wheels. The pilot and co-pilot cracked their side windows open to visually
					check that the main wheels were indeed down and then closed the windows. Opening the
					windows, however, had created a vacuum which sucked the air forward from the back of the
					airplane even though the door between the cockpit to the bomb bay was closed. In the cockpit
					there were no indications of a fire or the odor of gasoline in the cockpit. The passengers riding
					in the nose, however, began shouting back to the cockpit that they could smell gasoline.
					A quick check of the cockpit revealed no gasoline leaks or odors. Then, opening the door between
					the bomb bay and the cockpit, the engineer was greeted by a bomb bay that was full of heat
					and orange flames that made it impossible to enter. Quickly slamming the door closed,
					the pilots were alerted of the fire in the bomb bay. By this time the plane was on the final
					approach for landing and there was no alternative other than to continue landing. The plane
					rolled down the runway and came to a halt near the center of the runway, and every one
					escaped through the hatch, except the pilot who went out his window and slid down the side
					of the fuselage. Everyone was out safely. Fortunately the B-17 did not explode. The bomber just
					slowly burned away, until all that was left were parts of the wings with the engines, the main
					landing gears, a chunk of the nose, the vertical and horizontal stabilizers and the tail gunner's
					position. It was later determined that when the flaps were dropped, the activating solenoid
					located on the firewall below gasoline transfer lines had shorted out and burned through the
					lines used to transfer gasoline from the outboard wing Tokyo fuel tanks to the main tanks. {10 missions}.

					up about every three or four minutes. Nearing Berlin the group was straggling and strung out.
					Attacked by a large force of enemy fighters prior to the I.P., Luftwaffe twin-engined fighters were flying
					right through the group. The pilot escaped the worst of the carnage by easing back on the control
					wheel to avoid the bursts of 20mm cannon shells. Short of the target the fighters broke off contact
					when they encountered overcast but then the flak began. The bombs were released and the pilot

				 	No.3 and 4 caught fire. Unable to stop either engine, the fuel was cut-off and the propellers
					were left to windmill. Hydraulic fluid was leaking from the accumulator; an oxygen bottle
					in the cockpit exploded and set fire to the hydraulic fluid. The plane dropped out of formation
					and returned on its own. Speed was slow because of excess vibration at cruise speed.
					Approaching Osnabrück, Germany and down at 14,000ft, the plane was struck by more flak.
					Taking violent evasive action, the plane was dived down to 8,000ft. At this time the enlisted
					airmen in the rear were unaware of the situation and discussed bailing out. Over Osnabrück,
					more flak struck the bomber which, again, lost altitude quickly as if out of control. The five crew
					bailed out near Vechta, Germany and were immediately captured as they landed near an
					enemy airfield. By the time the plane reached the coast of the Netherlands it was down to 6,000ft.
					While the pilot did his best at the controls, other crew members were in the back throwing out
					guns, ammunition, and anything that would lighten the plane including the command set.
					The crew tried to make a run for it between two enemy held islands, the last enemy territory before
					the North Sea, but the shooting started. The Germans put up everything - rifles, pistols, machine guns,
					20mm, 40mm, and 88mms. The plane was so low that the crew could actually see the Germans
					running around on the ground below. When the windshield shattered into their laps, the pilots
					thought it was all over. Over the North Sea, No.2 engine failed and the plane managed to skim the
					waves back to England on one engine. Trying his luck, the pilot was able to restart No.4 engine
					and gain a little altitude. About an hour later and roughly eleven miles from the English coast,
					No.4 engine, which was running without fuel pressure or temperature, quit cold. Only No.1 engine
					was running with about 25 inches of mercury. Still flying at 2,000ft, the pilot didn't think they
					could make it and was worried about mines in the water near the shore. However, he tried it
					anyway, flying about 100 feet in the air crossing the coast, barely clearing the tops of a row of
					trees. With the last remaining engine it crash landed in a ploughed field at Horsey Gap on the
					coast northeast of Norwich, Norfolk.  Salvaged 23Mar44..  MACR 3434

					Deopham Green (Station 142), Norfolk 4Jan44. Named "Shed House Mouse" .  ttle damaged on a mission to the
					industrial areas of Frankfurt am Main, Germany 20Mar44 (1KIA:9RTD). High clouds frustrated bombing
					attempts and the squadron diverted to a target of opportunity. Flak over Bonn was intense and accurate,
					enemy fighters attacked northeast of Paris on the way home. The plane was ?ying #4 position;
					at bomb release, the aircraft in the #1 position above had two bombs hang up in the bomb bay after
					all the other bombs had dropped naturally. The procedure for kicking out hung up bombs was to
					wait until clear of the drop zone, move out of formation, then kick them out. The B-17 in the #1 position,
					without notifying anyone, kicked out the bombs while still in formation. The first bomb hit #525 to the
					left of the pilot damaging the No.2 propeller; the bomb, not yet armed, did not detonate when it struck
					the engine. The second bomb hit the Plexiglas nose section dead center, instantly killing the bombardier;
					again, the second bomb did not explode upon impact as it was not yet armed. With the Plexiglas
					now completely gone and the bombardier/navigator compartment demolished there was a terrific
					wind in the cockpit area. The interior pressure was so great that the door to the bomb bay could
					not be opened. No-one could go from the cockpit area to the radio room or the bomb bay;
					interphone was the only communications with the crew. The navigator, Johnson, worked his
					way rearward from what was left of the nose compartment to the cockpit and navigated the
					course back to England. The vibration from the damaged #2 propeller was so great that it
					caused the pilot to feather it. Meanwhile, due to the drag from the missing nose compartment,
					he couldn't maintain altitude and started to descend. After burning off excess fuel he was able to
					maintain an altitude of 1,000 feet. He managed to keep control to cross the English Channel and
					was able to manage a forced landing on an airfield at Dulverton, Somerset.

					En route to the target, crossing the River Rhine it was attacked by German fighters which managed
					to damage one of the engines. With the three remaining engines, the pilot was still able to stay
					in formation. Further strikes did little damage to the aircraft until a German fighter was able to
					disable a second engine over Munich. The enemy aircraft had damaged No.3 & No.4 engines and
					fuel was leaking from the right wing. Now the pilot had no choice but to jettison the bombs
					and leave the formation. Since it was now completely hopeless to fly back to England, he tried to
					make his way to Switzerland. The German fighters kept attacking the wounded aircraft, but the
					gunners managed to fend off the attackers until the plane reached the Swiss border. It crossed
					Lake Constance whereupon the pilot had to look for a suitable landing site, as the plane was
					slowly losing altitude. As it flew low down through a valley the Swiss air defense fired at it from
					the surrounding mountains. Several hits perforated our bomber without causing too much damage.
					Suddenly the city of Winterthur appeared in front. The pilot managed to keep the plane in the air
					and prevent a crash into the populated area. After dragging over the last houses, a wide plain
					opened up in front on which the bomber crash landed. The tail gunner's turret was torn off

					local low altitude formation flight. The first three planes of the lead element were already in place.
					The No.4 plane [42-31541] was forming a three plane element with the No.5 & 6 planes. The three planes
					were racing to catch up with the lead element and came on too fast. It was obvious to No.5 and No.6 that No.4,
					flying element lead, was overshooting. Each peeled off to the right and left. All this was happening at
					about 1500 feet. No.4 did in fact overshoot and pulled his tail up into the No.3 plane [42-38065].

					falling behind the formation, the crew disposed of all excess weight during the return to England.
					Two friendly Spitfires took up escort only to be mistaken by US P-47 Thunderbolts who riddled
					one of them badly. The No.2 propeller could not be feathered and had been windmilling; it was

					Initially knocked from the formation in a determined attack by a Fw 190 and a Bf 109, the
					plane then came under attack from the rear. The tail gunner and engineer/top turret gunner
					were wounded. Incoming fire from a rocket plane, a Me 163 Komet, was successfully avoided

					from a night flying training flight from Bassingbourn 11Sep44 (2INJ). The crew became lost
					but found the airfield after flares had been fired from the ground. Coming in too high and
					fast, the plane fell off in a slip to the right. There was a terrific crash, a bright flash in the
					cockpit when the right landing gear collapsed and the No.3 engine was blazing. The pilot
					jammed the throttles forward to get the plane off the runway and the airflow against the
					engine seemed to burn out some of the fire. The plane had touched down about ten feet
					short of the runway and the right wheel was laying on the runway. It had only gone about
					50ft down the runway and did a complete 180 degree turn off the runway to the right.
					The tire tracks indicated that it had been almost off the right side of the runway when it first hit.
					This same plane had landed that morning with a full bomb and fuel load after aborting a
					combat mission, so it seems that the shock with which the plane touched down was
					just enough to snap the gear that was probably weakened. Operations had it reported
					earlier in the evening that the altimeters were registering 'off' with the settings they were

					on a mission to the Heinkel Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory at Oranienburg, Germany 22Mar44.
					The weather confounded efforts to attack the Heinkel Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory, the bombers
					diverted to Berlin to destroy the Friedrichstraße railway station. Flak over Berlin was more intense
					than previous missions. One flak shell exploded above the cockpit and some shrapnel came down
					through the co-pilot's top window, striking the two pilots. On landing back at Bassingbourn the tail
					wheel collapsed; a piece of flak had lodged in the retracting actuator and prevented full extension.
					There were twenty-five flak holes on the left side of the airplane and as many on the other side.
					Failed to return from a mission to railway installations around Berlin, Germany 7May44 (2KIA:7POW).
					Flak over the target intense and struck No.3 engine. The propeller had to be feathered before smoke
					stopped streaming back from it. Observers reported seeing the plane drop back from the formation
					but follow behind, under control, all the way to the Ijsselmeer, Netherlands. At this point the bomber
					was down to 5,000ft when it was engaged by several flak batteries. While the two pilots struggled to
					keep control of the plane, the remaining crew bailed out into captivity. The pilot and co-pilot were
					unable to get out of the aircraft before it crashed and were killed. Crews reported that they had seen
					the bomber returning towards the enemy coast and several aircraft from the group went out on air-sea
					rescue searches in the vain hope of locating the crew; they found no trace. {25 missions).  MACR 4579

					Eighth Air Force, Toome, Northern Ireland 1Jan44. Base Air Depot No.1, Burtonwood (Station 590),
					Lancashire Jan44. On test flight crashed on a hillside near the National Childrens Home at Edgeworth,
					Bolton, Lancashire while flying blind in zero visibility 13Jan44 (4KIS). That day was typically dull
					overcast for the time of year, with the cloud base at approximately 1500 feet, but this should have
					presented no problems for the routine test flight of a newly delivered B-17 from the USAAF Base Air
					Depot at Burtonwood. On this day in addition to the usual three crew required for such a flight,
					there were also three passengers on board 'along for the ride'- two enlisted men and a civilian
					Engineer. After several minutes flying through the cloud, the pilot decided to turn for home and
					began to descend, expecting at any moment to break free of the cloud over the lowland plain
					west of Manchester. However during part of the flight the aircraft had been under the control of the
					Chief Ground Engineer - not an unusual practice - and despite careful observation on the part of the
					pilot, the aircraft had drifted further to the east than had been anticipated, over the hills near Bolton.
					At around 1100 feet the plane slammed into the hillside above the village of Edgeworth, the three
					passengers in the glazed bombardiers compartment and the Chief Ground Engineer in the co-pilot's
					seat being killed instantly. The disintegrating aircraft was torn apart and the fuel tanks exploded
					as the momentum carried the remains of the fuselage across the sloping meadow, scattering
					wreckage over a wide area. Dazed, the pilot managed to free himself and pulled the only other
					survivor, who was seriously wounded, clear of the shattered and burning cockpit.

					After the bomb run the plane dropped out from the 4th Bomb Wing formation and joined the
					34th Bomb Group formation returning to England from its mission to Geisecke. Near Koblenz,
					one of the 34th aircraft, 43-38971, was struck by flak, losing its wing. The damaged aircraft
					first rolled into a plane from the 487th, which remained flying, before colliding with #582,
					shearing off the tail. It went into a tight spin, the right wing folded and there was one explosion
					within the aircraft in mid-air. #582 then hit the ground in a wooded area and exploded again.
					The tail gunner was the only member of the crew able to bail out, after riding the tail section
					down to 8,000ft, at times losing consciousness from lack of oxygen. Amazingly, the ball turret
					gunner survived the fall, though sustaining serious injuries, trapped in the ball turret
					until it broke free of the aircraft as it crashed through some trees. The two gunners were captured.

					On April 29, 1944, Lt. Robert C. Stevenson was killed on his first mission en route to Berlin, Germany,

					going person. One evening a group of officers were out on the town having a good time when a bunch
					of rowdies started to hassle them. Lt. Stevenson was being pushed around, so the story goes, and when
					he had enough, he single-handedly cleared the house. Problem solved. So the officers called him
					'Ol' Scrapiron'. When Lt. Dahlgran, the original co-pilot, became Command Pilot he asked for his
					original crew back. They flew in aircraft 42-31582, thus the name 'Ol' Scrapiron' was voted by the entire crew.

					527th Bomb Squadron.  Named "Nobody's Baby"   Crashed during takeoff for a mission to railway
					marshalling yards at Neuss, Germany 23Jan45 (4KIA:5WIA + 5KIS on ground}. It was snowing
					lightly at Kimbolton on the morning of 23Jan45. The runways had been cleared by snowplows,
					there was an 8-mph wind out of the East-North-East. In the predawn twilight, visibility was
					estimated at 800 - 1000 yards. The aircraft taxied up just short of the runway. Although the plane
					was a veteran of many combat missions, this would be its first mission in several days. It was fueled
					with 2400 gallons of gasoline and armed with eight high explosive 500-pound bombs.
					In the cockpit a normal takeoff began. Between 110 and 120 mph, the plane's weight was
					coming off the tires. The pilot felt the plane bumping and eased back on the control stick.
					Vibration was increasing; not from the control surfaces but as if the wings themselves are shaking.
					The pilot fed in right rudder to try and hold the nose; no effect. The plane was flying and the co-pilot
					selected the landing gear to 'up'. The pilot tried to climb but there was no authority in the elevators.
					The plane was out of control, altitude maybe 25 feet. The plane continued to turn left and trees
					appeared ahead. The pilot cut the throttles for the two engines on the right wing in a final
					attempt to straighten out the plane before it hits. The plane tore through telephone wires
					and power lines; trees tore off the left wing outboard of the No.1 engine. The fuel tanks in
					the wing ruptured and flames erupted. One thousand yards from the runway was the
					communal living area for the 525th Bomber Squadron.barracks, mess hall and
					administrative buildings. Without warning to those on the ground and with no time to sound
					alarm, the fully loaded bomber crashed directly into the 525th's Orderly Building. There
					were several hundred men in the living site that morning. Some were asleep and some were
					awake. The fuel tanks exploded more or less on impact. Thick black smoke billowed from
					the crash site. Most men, startled awake by the blast, streamed away from the inferno
					half-dressed and shoe-less in the snow. From across the field, ambulances and fire crews
					could be heard on the way. The plane burned furiously; flames reached into the cockpit.
					Ammunition from the guns cooked off in the fire spraying rounds indiscriminately.
					When the plane came to a stop; the cockpit was partially ripped open. The co-pilot was
					temporarily knocked out but then regained consciousness. Men from the site came to the
					aid of those still trapped in the burning wreckage. Of the nine men aboard, five got out,
					all injured. A few minutes after the crash, the flames reached the bomb bay. The first bomb
					that cooked off killed a total of nine men and left many more wounded. Four of the dead
					were from the aircrew but the remainder were would be rescuers. Several other bombs
					later exploded also leaving every building in the site destroyed or damaged. Many men
					lost all their clothing and personal items. Later other unexploded bombs were found and
					made safe by bomb disposal crews

					constituted a drag on the aircraft, and along with the loss of gasoline from the wing tanks, would result
					in the aircraft running short of fuel before it could get back. The plane plunged from its spot in the formation
					and went careening through the sky, barely missing other planes. One engine was out now, and another
					was weakening. The plane began dropping back and down. As it neared the French coast, another
					engine quit. The pilot, noting that the fuel was almost exhausted, ordered the crew to prepare to ditch.

					exhaustion, the crew went to their ditching positions. They escaped and sat in their dinghies for about
					half an hour, when they were rescued by a friendly vessel. Just as they were pulling away in the rescue

					Damaged by flak on a mission to a target of an oil dump on the Seine River across from the city of

					The pilot brought his damaged plane back to base and prepared for a crash landing.
					When he touched down without brakes the plane veered to the right and hit the wing of
					another aircraft, and then crashed head-on into a parked aircraft, 42-38056, on its hardstand.
					Both caught fire immediately and were completely consumed by flames, shooting two and three
					hundred feet into the air. Fifty caliber shells were exploding; projectiles and pieces of metal flew
					through the air. Flares were going off continually and the heat was terrific. Miraculously the
					entire crew escaped. An assistant engineering officer with the 749th and a flight chief raced
					to the scene. The wing of the first aircraft to be hit, before the head- on collision, was actually
					overlapped the fuselage of one of the burning aircraft. The fuel tanks were partially filled, and
					that if the fire developed, the aircraft would explode. Despite the difficulties encountered and the
					danger involved, the two airmen succeeded in moving the aircraft a safe distance from the fire.
					After this was accomplished, the two men returned to the scene of the fire and repeated the performance
					by moving another Fortress away from the flames. It was found later that the wing on the first
					aircraft to be taxied away had actually begun to melt. Salvaged 22Jun44.

					the engines started overspeeding, the flight controls were not responsive. Cannon shells
					exploded in the top turret killing the gunner. The ball turret took several direct 20mm

					Was reported to be first B-17 attacked by Me 163 rocket-propelled fighter August 16, 1944.
					Lowell Getz, who wrote "Pandemonium Over Pelsen - The Forgotten Final Mission" about the
					last combat mission of the Eighth Air Force, provided information indicating that while the
					OUTHOUSE MOUSE is widely reported as the first B-17 to be attached by the "Rocket" fighter
					the Me-163 and is depicted in the famous Jerry Crandall painting titled "The Mouse and the Flea"
					that the attack was really against another B-17 on that same mission -
					No.42-31579 "Betty Lou's Buggy". If Lowell is correct, there are a LOT of books that tell of the
					incident that are wrong.

					a Fw 190, caught fire and exploded. The pilot was flying on the right wing of the
					leader and, since fighter opposition was quite intense, he as well as other pilots,
					were flying a very close formation. The squadron arrived at the Initial Point (IP)
					and moved into bombing formation. When about one minute into the bomb run,
					the fighter attacks intensified. Two enemy fighters were making a head-on attack on
					the leader of the squadron. The rate of closure was very fast and it appeared that both
					fighters were dead set on ramming the bomber. The lead Fw 190 had the other
					Fw 190 on his left wing and, at the last moment, peeled to his right. The upper
					turret gunner shot at the fighter and it went down on fire. The wing Fw 190 peeled
					to his left and pulled up the nose of the fighter. The aircraft was standing on its
					tail and went into a high speed stall - or the pilot was dead at the controls.
					It hit - or the bomber flew into it - between number three and four engines of the
					B-17. Immediately the bomber burst into flames on the right wing and the Fw 190
					was stuck to the aircraft. They hung for a split second and the squadron leader,
					being on the bomb run, could do nothing to get out of the way of an inevitable
					blast of an exploding B-17. The bomber fell about 500 feet before it exploded
					This probably saved some of the other bombers by not exploding at their altitude.

					During the summer of 1943 at RAF St Eval, Padstow, Cornwall, No.1404 Meteorological
					Flight became No.517 Squadron and began re-equipping with the Handley-Page Halifax.
					Because of this No.517 was unable to maintain its operational committment of twice-daily
					meteorological reconnaissance sorties to the southwest over Biscay (code-named EPICURE).
					Such was the importance of these flights that the USAAF offered four B-17s to make up the
					shortfall - adding another four aircraft later. Initially these were detached to RAF St Eval
					and operated to the west of the UK (code-named ALLAH), but during the autumn it was
					decided the USAAF aircraft should operate from an American base - Bovingdon (Station 112),
					Hertfordshire. As the USAAF didn't have aircrew trained in meteorological observing,
					the crews always flew with an RAF Meteorological Air Observer (MAO)

					damage affected the nose compartment of the plane and Tony Starcer repainted the pin-up girl
					at this time and made some slight amendments to his original imagery. The girl became
					slightly slimmer as well as a brunette, the Air Force cap was omitted and the dress received
					a different pattern. The title lettering however remained identical and untouched.
					Accident after a mission to the industrial areas of Brunswick, Germany 29Mar44. The bomber

					The aircraft was attacked by enemy fighters and took 20mm cannon hits; on the third attack
					two 20mm cannon shells went in No.2 fuel tank. The bomber caught fire and was

					oil facilities at Mücheln, west of Merseburg, Germany 11Sep44. Seriously battle
					damaged on a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical and synthetic oil works at Leuna,
					Merseburg, Germany 2Nov44. The box barrage of flak was heavy around the target.
					An estimated 500 Luftwaffe fighters went up to meet the bomber force. Just after the target,
					the formation was subject to a barrage of flak. Once out of the flak, the plane was
					attacked by German fighters which shot up one engine. It couldn't stay in formation
					so the pilot headed down to stay underneath it. The crippled plane couldn't keep up
					with the formation. The ball turret gunner ran out of ammunition and the tail
					gunner's guns wouldn't work. Saved by the arrival of US fighters, the pilot headed for
					home, losing altitude as it went. then a flak burst destroyed another engine. The co-pilot
					invited the crew to bail out before he took the crippled plane down to treetop level.
					No one jumped. Flak gunners were shooting at the plane all the time. There was no relief
					even when the plane reached the North Sea German shore batteries spotted the low-flying
					bomber and commenced firing. Shells hit the water and exploded in front of the plane;
					some would explode above the water. The concussion would hit the water and then hit the plane.
					The plane had one more ordeal; sixty miles from base. The fuel gauge showed empty.
					Air-Sea Rescue was alerted but the B-17 wouldn't quit. It reached the English coastline
					and set down on the short runway of a fighter base. Skidding out of control, the B-17
					ended its flight in the mud of a farmer's field. The serious damaged put the aircraft
					out of action for most of that month. Repaired, it was put back into combat and continued

					to the docks at Wilhelmshaven, Germany 27Aug44. A Tokyo fuel tank and a propeller
					governor were struck by flak allowing the propeller to overspeed. Failed to return
					from a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical and synthetic oil works at Leuna, Merseburg,
					Germany 13Sep44 (6POW:3KIA). En route from the I.P. for the run on target, one
					of the four engines failed and the pilot had to feather the propeller. The plane remained
					in formation and continued toward the target. The plane was flying at 29,500ft when it
					was hit by flak. The pilot didn't hear the aircraft get hit by flak, but an intense fire
					immediately started ahead of the instrument panel, on the right side of the fuselage.
					He later determined that the fire was probably caused by the oxygen and oil lines being
					severed by flak. The aircraft needed to lose altitude quickly and leave formation,
					so that if the aircraft exploded it would not damage the other B-17s in the formation.
					The fire on board was so intense from the start that the pilot immediately gave the order
					to bail out. His crew members in the back of the aircraft complied and bailed out not far
					from Mersberg, three other crew members, the Co-pilot, Bombardier and Navigator,
					were gathered in the nose of the aircraft around the open escape hatch. The Top Turret
					gunner/engineer remained with the pilot in the cockpit and attempted to extinguish the fire.
					The fire continued to grow in intensity very quickly and the airmen chose to also bail out,
					The pilot believed that the three crew members in the nose had already vacated the aircraft
					but he found them still gathered around the open front hatch. He quickly returned to the
					flight deck in order to stabilise the aircraft as well as possible and allow the other crew
					members to bail out. On his return to the cockpit, the pilot stood behind the pilot's seat
					reaching out for the controls, the flames prevented him getting any closer. During the short
					time he attempted to stabilise the aircraft, he received burns on his face and neck and
					right wrist. The engineer and pilot looked to the front hatch, but the flames were so intense
					they couldn't see the other crew members and did not dare to attempt to go through the
					fire in order to bail out themselves. They therefore headed for the bomb bay, where they
					bailed out and landed close to Halle, Germany. The plane exploded and crashed near

					During the summer of 1943 at RAF St Eval, Padstow, Cornwall, No.1404
					Meteorological Flight became No.517 Squadron and began re-equipping with the
					Handley-Page Halifax. Because of this No.517 was unable to maintain its operational
					committment of twice-daily meteorological reconnaissance sorties to the
					southwest over Biscay (code-named EPICURE). Such was the importance of these
					flights that the USAAF offered four B-17s to make up the shortfall - adding another
					four aircraft later. Initially these were detached to RAF St Eval and operated to the
					west of the UK (code-named ALLAH), but during the autumn it was decided the USAAF
					aircraft should operate from an American base - Bovingdon (Station 112), Hertfordshire.
					As the USAAF didn't have aircrew trained in meteorological observing, the crews
					always flew with an RAF Meteorological Air Observer (MAO)

					and rendered unconscious, the radio operator wounded and the plane severely damaged.
					Nevertheless members of the crew managed to right the plane and fly it back to their home station,
					where they contacted the control tower and reported the situation. Even though they had no
					flight eperience, the navigator and engineer volunteered to attempt to land the plane.
					Other members of the crew were ordered to jump, leaving the navigator and engineer and the
					unconscious pilot aboard. After observing the distressed aircraft from another plane,
					their commanding officer decided the damaged plane could not be landed by the inexperienced crew
					and ordered them to abandon it and parachute to safety. The navigator and engineer replied
					that the pilot was still alive but could not be moved and that they would not desert him.
					They were then told to attempt a landing. After two unsuccessful efforts their plane
					crashed into an open field near the Great North Road at Glatton, Northamptonshire
					in a third attempt to land at Polebrook. The navigator, engineer, and the wounded pilot were killed.
					6 missions.  Navigator and flight engineer were awarded Medal of Honor.

					The plane was hit somewhere over Hungary and seriously damaged by enemy
					fighters. It will never be precisely known what happened thereafter.
					The event was witnessed only by six gunners from three bombers flying
					in the formation of the 463rd Bomber Group. The plane was attacked
					about one hour before the estimated time of reaching their target during
					the second attack by twin-engine Messerschmitt Bf 110s fighters. Engine No.2
					was hit first followed by engine No.1. The plane dropped out of its formation
					to the right side, jettisoned its bombs and turned to return home, being
					followed by several enemy fighters. Both engines smoked intensely without
					any flames being observed. The plane was seen the last time in the area
					over the Hungarian-Slovakian border, north of the River Danube.
					On its return flight it was most probably attacked again by enemy fighters
					and when its pilot concluded that he could not continue to fly, he probably
					decided to make an forced landing in the vicinity of the village of Hum Voèinski
					in northern Yugoslavia. The last moments of its flight were observed by two
					Yugoslavian citizens who presented a written statement about the event: "We saw

					what was believed to be an allied airfield near Brussels. The bomber encountered
					flak; a shell burst in the aircraft which killed the waist gunner and wounded the

					Named "Sectiion Eight". The crew of this plane was an original crew with the Group.
					After arriving in UK the flight engineer decided their plane needed a name.
					There was not much feeling either way when he suggested 'Section Eight', and everyone
					agreed with that name. He arranged to get the name with an Eight Ball design painted on
					the plane. In United States military terms, a 'Section 8' means a discharge based on
					military assessment of psychological unfitness or character traits deemed undesirable.
					In their mind it meant they must be 'crazy' for getting into a bomber and flying over Germany
				 	Failed to return from a mission to railway facilities around Berlin, Germany 29Apr44 (10RTD).
					The combat wing was off course heading to Berlin, attacked by enemy fighters and
					bombed Magdeburg. Flak over the target was very accurate. Over Brunswick en
					route to the target the No.1 engine was struck by flak and disabled, later No.2
					engine was also disabled by flak over the target. The plane lost altitude as flak
					continued to burst all around it and there was a large hole in the left wing.
					As the crew worked their way back to England, the Fortress was flying on just two
					engines. It fell further behind the formation until the crew lost sight of it. The airmen
					threw out anything they could to lighten the load and maintain altitude. The radio
					operator sent out a SOS message repeatedly to British Air-Sea Rescue for position
					reports incase of a ditching. The plane lost altitude over the Netherlands and the
					North Sea. Then the remaining two engines failed after an extended period at full power.
					The pilot successfully ditched the bomber in the North Sea and the crew escaped
					into life rafts. After about forty-five minutes, the crew was rescued by a British Air-Sea
					Rescue launch. The Fortress was still afloat so was sunk with help from the boat crew
					and a machine gun. It sank about ten miles from the English coast.

					Named "Superstitious Aloysius" the name of a popular cartoon character.
					Chosen from a good luck card sent to a crew member.  Battle damaged on a mission to a Luftwaffe
					airfield at Oldenburg, Germany 8Apr44 (2WIA:8RTD). The 91st Bomb Group was the last group
					over the target and took very heavy flak. Just after bomb release an 88mm shell exploded near No.3 engine
					and the propeller could not be feathered. At the same time it shorted out the electrical controls for the
					wheels and flaps, causing both to fully extend. Before the crew could crank them up manual1y, the
					bomber found itself alone over Oldenburg, the very last bomber in the area. Flak crews began to take
					pot shots at it and succeeded in knocking out the supercharger on No.2 engine and putting over 200
					holes in the fuselage, wings, and nose. Both the navigator and bombardier received minor wounds.
					The radio operator succeeded in contacting Air-Sea Rescue before the plane lost too much altitude.
					Consequently, fighters were directed to escort the bomber out of enemy territory. For a while it appeared
					that the plane would have to ditch in the IJsselmeer due to loss of altitude and difficulty in transferring fuel.
					However, the fuel problem was solved and No.2 engine provided more power at low altitude, so the
					decision was made to try for the North Sea. British Air-Sea Rescue set a course for the plane to
					follow. Soon the reason became apparent as rescue boats were spotted all the way across the sea.
					Finally, the bomber landed safely back at Bassingbourn, about forty-five minutes after the main group
					had landed. Battle damaged on a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Metz, France 25Apr44. Battle damaged
					on a tactical mission to coastal defences at Houlgate, France 5Jun44. Failed to return from a mission to an
					oil refinery at Mockau, Leipzig, Germany 20Jul44 (3KIA:6POW). When the Luftwaffe decided to pick off
					the 91st Bomb Group there were no friendly fighters in the area to defend it. As the formation drew close
					to Leipzig, wave after wave of German fighters attacked. The plane survived the initial attack, although
					sustaining some damage. Then a further attack destroyed No.2 engine and set the left wing on fire.
					The pilot pulled out of the formation and ordered his crew to bail out. A section of right wing broke
					off as the plane lost altitude rapidly while the pilot struggled to keep it in the air long enough for a
					mortally wounded airman to bail out. Finally the plane blew up, hurling the pilot free. Crashed
					Ruppertsgrün, Germany. {11 missions}.   6 POW, 3 KIA (one by German civilians).

					Named "Berlin Special".  Accident departing for a mission to Munich, Germany 11Jul44.
					Flying at 15,000ft southwest of Watford, Hertfordshire during formation assembly, the oxygen
					exploded starting a fire. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out and then turned the plane towards
					the North Sea. With the plane on autopilot, the pilot left his seat to check that his crew had
					gone before bailing out. He was suddenly aware that the roar of the fire had stopped, presumably
					because the oxygen had been burnt off. Beating out some small residual fires and with the panic
					over, he regained his seat and started to look for somewhere to land. The bomber was still
					near London and had a full bomb load. The pilot spotted an airfield with some B-17s parked
					and approach to land. Warned off by red flares the plane regained altitude while the pilot
					inspected the aircraft. Finding nothing wrong, he started an approach to a Martin B-26 Marauder
					airfield. On touchdown there was a screeching sound; the ball turret guns had been left pointing
					straight down so that the gunner could exit. Failed to return from a mission to the manufacturing
					facilities of the Junkers Flugzeug-und Motorenwerke at Dessau, Germany 20Jul44 (4POW:5EVD).

					The formation had run through heavy flak to drop their bombs, then turned to head out over the
					North Sea back to England. It was attacked by German fighters al 22,000ft. The pilots fought to
					remain in formation so that they could use each other's guns to defend the group. The pilot of this
					B-17 saw a plane ahead of him burst into flames and slide out. He moved his plane forward to fill
					in the gap and felt an impact. The big bomber shuddered and began losing altitude. The pilot
				 	knew that he had collided with another plane, B-17G, 43-38457. The top turret of #457 was now
					locked in the lower fuselage of #987 and the ball turret in #987 had smashed through the top of #457.
					The two bombers were almost aligned, the tail of the lower plane was slightly to the left of the upper
					plane's tail. Three of the engines on the bottom plane were still running as were all four of the upper.
					The fourth engine on the lower bomber was on fire and the flames were spreading to the rest of
					the aircraft. The two were losing altitude quickly. The pilot of #987 tried several times to break
					free of the other plane but they were inextricably locked together. Fearing a fire, the pilot of #987
					cut his engines and rang the bailout bell. lf his crew had any chance of parachuting, he had to
					keep the plane under control. The ball turret gunner was trapped inside the fuselage of the
				 	lower plane, unable to rotate the turret to exit. The pilot ordered his co-pilot to jump but he
					wouldn't; he realised that it would take the strength of both of them to maintain any control.
					In the cockpit, they held firmly to the controls. The ground came up faster and faster and they
					slammed into the ground. The lower plane exploded, vaulting #987 upward and forward. It hit the
					ground and slid along until its left wing slammed through a German headquarters wooden building
					and came to a stop. The nose of the plane was relatively intact, but everything from the wings back
					was destroyed. Crashed at Rüstringen, Wangerooge, East Frisian island, Germany.  MACR 11550

					In the middle of heavy anti-aircraft fire, part of the nose was shot off and the wing tips were

					in the plane were terrific. The windows came open. It was nearly impossible to keep the throttles on.
					The aircraft couldn't hold altitude or airspeed and dropped from 27,000 to 17,000ft in a matter of
					seconds. Then No.4 engine oversped and couldn't be feathered. The vibration died down and the
					pilot was able to gain control of the plane. The aircraft had left the formation and took a heading
					which would be shortest to allied territory. Flak hit the chin turret ammunition and knocked
					off half the chin turret. It hit the right nose gun ammunition box, setting off six rounds of
					ammunition which grazed the bombardier. The box was split open spreading shells all over the nose.
					There was a big hole in the Plexiglas nose causing more drag. Flak burst in the runway under the
					pilot's seat, knocking loose the armor plate. More flak made a huge hole in the right stabiliser
					and set off ammunition in the tail gunner's compartment. The plane was in a 30 degree bank,
					right wing up, which was necessary to hold a course. All armor plate and other equipment had been
					thrown overboard and the crew was trying to get rid of the ball turret, but didn't have enough
					time left for that. The ball turret gunner bailed out at 3,000ft. All the others went back to the radio
					room and prepared for a crash landing. The bomber crash landed in a cabbage patch near
					Gosselies, Belgium, where another Fortress had crash landed about a month before. The guards
					from the other Fortress came running up. The landing was smooth, considering the terrain. Everyone
					in the radio room got out easily, but the pilots had difficulty. {78 missions}. Salvaged 6Nov44

					and burned out 20May44 (10KIS). 36 planes were scheduled to take off in groups of 12 each
					starting just before daylight. The fog was so bad they walked along the side of the planes to the
					runway. The pilots took off by 'stop watch' every 30 seconds. The high group was successfully
					airborne and the lead group started taking off. B-17G 42-32001 was the 7th in this group. Apparently
					its tail wheel unlocked during roll off and the B-17 veered off the runway. The pilot attempted to get
					corrected and pulled back onto the runway, but just as it began to get airborne, the bomber struck
					part of a concrete wall, and then crashed just beyond the edge of the runway. The B-17's load of bombs d
					etonated, killing all the crew aboard. The next B-17 in line, 42-37934, had begun its run but stopped
					approximately half way down the runway, apparently having seen the red warning flares fired by the
					runway controller and heard the radio order from the control tower to stop takeoff. The pilot turned
					his plane around and started back up the runway, but the following bomber in line, B-17G 42-97489
					did not stop its run. Presumably the pilot could not see the flares through the low hanging fog, and when
					he did see the other Fortress, it was far too late. The aircraft collided head on and burst into flames.
					Five crew members managed to escape from each plane, all being near the rear, before the first of five
					terrific explosions began, about three minutes after the collision. The final explosion was the aircraft
					which had been the first to crash. All aircraft were carrying 6x 1000lb GP bombs. Eleven officers and

					Sudetenland 25Dec44 (2KIA:8POW). The bomber seemed to be ill fated from the beginning.
					Long before it reached the target, the ball turret gunner spun his turret around and broke an oxygen
					connection; thus the plane lost half of its oxygen supply. During the bombing run the plane was
					hit by flak but held course until the bombs were dropped. The number two engine and the
					hydraulic system had been knocked out; the number one engine was partially disabled.
					Because the hydraulic system was inoperative the bomb bay doors had to be cranked shut by hand.
					The propellers of the damaged engines could not be feathered; they kept wind milling and
					sometimes caused the whole plane to shudder. The crew knew that they couldn't go back to
					base and so a decision was made to head for friendly, Russian, territory. As it went on the
					plane was losing altitude and so the crew threw out guns and whatever they could get their
					hands on to lighten the load; the ball turret was jettisoned. An enemy fighter joined up and,
					from his motions, he wanted the pilot to follow him to his base. The pilot refused because that
					would have given the Germans a plane to study. The fighter attacked the bomber which was
					now full of holes and on fire. Some of the crew tried to check on the pilot and co-pilot but the

					a popular song by the Andrews Sisters)" Mar 23, 1944.  A third "Shoo" was added to the same at some point in
					May 1944.  {first combat mission 24Mar44}. Arguably the most interesting sortie took place when
					Gdynia on the Baltic coast in Poland was the assigned target 9Apr44. The 91st Bomb Group war diary
					entry for that mission reads "9-4- 44. Gdynia recalled," with a cryptic addition: "1 A/C Marienburg, Completed."
					The story behind this terse entry is remarkable. The crew took off from Bassingbourn in miserable weather.
					Entering a holding pattern, the pilot spotted a formation of Fortress's from another bomb group,
					though he couldn't see any other 91st Bomb Group B-17s. The bombers were heading northeast, toward the
					Baltic Sea, but their target was not Gdynia. South of Sweden they turned toward the German coastline.
					When they approached the coast the navigator immediately picked up Gdynia and Danzig, which
					obviously were not the targets, and the aircraft changed course. About that time there was a terrific
					flak barrage and hundreds of fighters. The crew opened the bomb bay doors and headed for the
					target when the others did, though they really didn't know what it was. Having bombed a target
					at Marienburg, the crew encountered an unusual problem. A shell burst ahead and above the
					bomber emitting what appeared to be a big puff of brown smoke. Immediately, another burst just
					above, and the whole plane was covered with what looked to be brown tobacco juice. The
					windows and windshields were completely covered, and the wipers only made it worse.
					The only way the pilot could see to fly for the rest of the trip was to slide back the windows a bit and stick
					a head out. Just after the crew landed at Bassingbourn, having been airborne for 12 hours and 55 minutes,
					the engines stopped dead due to fuel exhaustion. When the crew asked how many other Forts had
					made it back, the response was, "Nobody, because nobody else left!" Due to a malfunctioning radio,
					Shoo Shoo Baby hadn't received the recall message. Failed to return from a mission to the Focke-Wulf
					aircraft factory at Pozna?, Poland 29May44 (9INT). Crossing the German border No.3 engine failed
					and the propeller would not feather. Further trouble cropped up over the target, when another engine
					was damaged by flak. Unable to make it back to England, the crew decided to head for Sweden. Loose
					equipment was jettisoned to reduce weight. Just before reaching the Swedish coast a third engine failed,
					and the bomber was losing altitude fast. A Swedish fighter came up and led it to Malmö, where a B-24,
					also in trouble, landed just ahead and the B-17 had to swing wide to keep from colliding. Force l
					anded at Bulltofta, near Malmö, Sweden. {24 missions}. . Traded to the Swedish government along with

					(1WIA:8RTD). Flak was very heavy and the plane received a direct hit in the middle.
					The waist gunner was hit in the back of his leg just above the knee. All of the oxygen
					lines were cut so the pilot had to drop below 10,000ft. The plane received another
					hit and the control cables to the rudder were cut. The tail gunner did the best he could
					to tie the cables together while the pilot looked for an emergency airfield to set down in.

					Italy 22Apr44. Severely battle damaged on a mission to the Shell oil refinery at Budapest,
					Hungary 14Jul44 (4WIA:6RTD). The mission was normal until they were over the
					target with the bomb bay doors open. All of a sudden there was the loudest noise and
					most violent concussion they had ever experienced from flak. The bomber had received a
					direct flak hit and the controls reacted as if they had been severed by the blast. The crew
					noted the plane was not perpendicular to the wings due to the air frame being warped.
					When the automatic pilot was engaged, it brought the slack controls back into limited use,
					making it possible to gain control over direction. The bomb bay caught fire and the catwalk
					had been blasted where it terminated at the radio room wall, hundreds of holes in the fuselage
					skin, and all electrical facilities had been knocked out. It was at this time that a plane from
					another squadron dropped out of formation to fly escort for them as they were behind the
					Group formation and losing altitude. The bomb bay fire was extinguished and the crew
					began the sensitive job of prying four fully armed bombs from the racks to get at another
					bomb wedged in the upper rack. The job to empty the bomb bay took 45 minutes,
					using the only tools available  a large screwdriver and a pair of pliers, and was
					possible because one bomb bay door had been blown off when the shell exploded.
					The oxygen system was completely destroyed, requiring the plane to drop to a lower altitude.
					On reaching the Yugoslavian coast, the No.3 engine gave out and efforts to transfer
					fuel proved futile. After what seemed like hours, they realized that they would make it back to Italy.
					A check of the hydraulic system showed it was empty, indicating the aircraft would not
					have brakes when landing. A check of the landing gear showed its power source was
					non-existent and would have to be cranked into position. Needing a long runway, and
					immediate hospital facilities, the crew decided to land at Foggia Main. With no radio
					capability, they depended on emergency flares to warn of their approach. The bombardier
					devised a braking system utilizing parachutes (attached to each waist gun mount) which
					were opened as the aircraft touched down. A cross wind, catching the parachutes, caused
					the plane to swing around and head for a row of parked planes. Fortunately the bomber
					came to a stop before adding to the day of mishaps. The damage to the plane is reflected
					in the way the crew members worked as a well-trained team to keep the plane in the air
					long enough to reach Italy and a base with a long runway. An official survey of the flak-riddled
					plane revealed a total of 30,748 holes, an Air Force record. Each crew member was
					awarded a Silver Star and each of the four wounded members was presented with the
					Purple Heart, making this the 'Most Decorated One Mission Crew' in Air Force history.
					The pilot was also nominated for the Distinguished Service Cross, making this an
					outstanding crew and a truly remarkable mission for the records. Salvaged 15Jul44

					heater tubes.

					Damaged on a mission to the synthetic oil refinery at Gelsenkirchen, Germany 5Nov43 (1WIA).
					Before the target, flak damaged No.4 engine and holed the wing either side. More flak struck
					the fuselage, damaging the hydraulic system and a burst hit the ball turret. Without brakes,
					the pilot made a slow approach to land back at Ridgewell with the intention of ground looping
					off the runway to stop in a muddy patch of the infield. With people lining both sides of the
					runway to watch the group arrive back, the pilot had to remain on the runway and, at an excessive
					speed, ran over rough ground, a road and ditches. Heading towards a country lane, an English
					soldier was cycling along, unaware of what was about to happen. He missed the propellers as the
					plane rode over his bicycle. The plane headed for a ditch near where two elderly women were
					sitting on a fence. The wheels dropped into the ditch throwing one wing into the ditch and the
					other up at an angle. The women and soldier escaped injury. Failed to return from a mission
					to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 manufacturing factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44
					(5KIA:4MIA:1POW). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases
					and a recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division,
					continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy
					fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration
					and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal support but
					they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for themselves
					on the return trip. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when the
					American fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run,
					with intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. Flak damaged three engines and attacked by

					new assignments. They, along with their guns, were on railway trucks close to the airfield, the gunners
					watching in amazement as the bombers headed towards them following the railway lines! Added to
					this was the fact that because of the supposed weak opposition expected, the bomber force had
					descended to a lower altitude to ensure pin-point accuracy with their bombing, thus presenting the
					Germans with a target they just could not fail to miss. The bomber was heavily damaged,
					having two engines knocked out, but continued to hold its course, releasing its bomb load
					and then fell out of formation. The crew bailed out before the plane crashed on Medis airfield,

					Met Observers from 517Sq). Took off using all of runway and crashed down a slope through the trees
					in Bourne Wood, burning as it hit the ground. During the summer of 1943 at RAF St Eval, Padstow,
					Cornwall, No.1404 Meteorological Flight became No.517 Squadron and began re-equipping with the
					Handley-Page Halifax. Because of this No.517 was unable to maintain its operational committment
					of twice-daily meteorological reconnaissance sorties to the southwest over Biscay (code-named EPICURE).
					Such was the importance of these flights that the USAAF offered four B-17s of the 379th Bomb Group to
					make up the shortfall - adding another four aircraft later. Initially these were detached to RAF St Eval
					and operated to the west of the UK (code-named ALLAH), but during the autumn it was decided the
					USAAF aircraft should operate from an American base - Bovingdon. As the USAAF didn't have aircrew
					trained in meteorological observing, the crews always flew with an RAF Meteorological Air Observer (MAO).
					The crash was witnessed by a ten year old boy, Roy Payne, and over the years he kept returning to the
					crash site, collecting small pieces of debris. Forty-three years after the accident (1976) he found two
					gold rings. One was a pilot's ring inscribed with the name William Holcom, the other was a Bombadier's
					ring inscribed with the intials HJ. 2nd Lt Holcomb was the co-pilot of 42-37744, and in 2003 Roy
					eventually traced the American's family and returned the ring to them. For the second ring, the initials
					did not match those any of the American crew-members nor, as far as could be determined, any of those
					who dealt with the aftermath of the crash. It was thought possible it might have been given to the RAF
					met observer as a mark of respect..

					during a mission to the port area at Bremen, Germany 29Nov43 (1KIA:2INJ). On the initial run
					over the target the bomber was damaged by flak with a hole in the bomb bay doors. With the target
					obscured by clouds, a second run was made during which the left aileron control cables were
					shot away by cannon fire from an enemy fighter causing the bomber to veer out of formation.
					Regaining control and returning to its position, the bomber was attacked head-on by a Fw 190
					fighter. Around that time the crew experienced problems with their oxygen supplies. The ball
					turret gunner was instructed to exit his turret but did not do so, nor could the waist gunners
					extract him. As soon as the pilot was sure that they were clear of the Frisian Islands he left the
					formation and descended through breaks in heavy cumulus clouds to 800 feet. They reached
					the English coast four or five miles east of Cromer, Norfolk. By that time a combination of
					darkness and extremely poor visibility made navigation difficult. About two or three minutes
					after crossing the coast a searchlight was turned on almost directly beneath the bomber and
					directed it to an airfield which was about ten miles away. The bomber landed safely at RAF
					Coltishall near Norwich, Norfolk. It is likely that loss of oxygen caused the gunner to die of anoxia.
					Both waist gunners suffered from frostbite and nervous shock and were removed to a US Hospital.
					The B-17 was repaired and returned to Grafton Underwood 2Dec43. Following a routine formation

					Battle damaged during a mission to the railway marshalling yards at Frankfurt am Main,
					Germany 8Feb44 (1WIA). It was just after dropping bombs on the target that a huge blast of
					black flak appeared above the nose, a short distance ahead of the aircraft. The oil pressure
					start to fall on the left outboard engine and the pilot quickly feathered the propeller.
					A few seconds later the same thing occured to the right outboard engine and that was feathered too.
					The pilot knew they could get home on just two engines but would lose a lot of speed.
					Just then the nose dropped, and despite full throttle on the two inboard engines the plane
					started losing height at about 150ft a minute  as well as the speed dropping down to just 95mph.
					The position worsened as the plane returned from its mission and by now three of the four
					engines were out of action. It was touch and go whether it would cross the Channel.
					The pilot brought the bomber in over the gasworks at Black Rock, Brighton, Sussex and
					followed the line of Wilson Avenue up to the racecourse looking desperately for somewhere
					to land. At last he found a field but the fuel was low in the one remaining engine which kept
					cutting out. Somehow the pilot managed to avoid landing on houses in Patcham on the northern
					outskirts of Brighton. He steered the plane under power lines and past a post supporting them
					before crash landing in a ploughed field at Braypool. Despite travelling at 70mph on impact,
					the crew were uninjured apart from one man who sprained his ankle. The B-17 was repaired and took
					off a few days later, watched by a large crowd. 2nd Strategic Air Depot, Abbots Ripton (Station 547),
					Huntingdonshire 10Feb44. Regained by Group 12Mar44. Failed to return from a mission to the
					Dornier Flugzeugwerke factory at Oberpfaffenhofen, Munich, Germany 18Mar44 (10INT).
					As the plane turned at the I.P. for the bomb run, flak struck No.3 engine rupturing an oil line.
					The engine was still producing some power and the plane was able to maintain position in
					the formation. Just as the bombs were released, the No.1 engine was hit and started to burn.
					By now the bomber is lagging behind the formation with two engines inoperative. The pilot
					headed for Switzerland, escorted by P-38s through a mountain pass to the south. The supercharger
					on No.2 engine was inoperative 30 minutes before reaching the initial point, was running rough
					and lost oil. The No.1 engine propeller would not feather, vibrated badly and oversped over the target.
					The supercharger on No.3 engine did not function properly. Two engines were on fire when the bomber
					crash landed on the small airfield at Altenrhein, near Lake Constance, Switzerland. {13 missions).

					Named "Fletcher's Castoria III".  Failed to return from a mission to bomb

					wreck and had never completed a mission giving one mechanical problem after another.
					The crew completed their bomb run over the target and as they flew back over the North Sea
					lost two engines due to oil loss. The navigator advised the pilot that they were 130 miles from
					the English coast. Then they lost a 3rd engine and their speed fell to 60 odd miles an hour  and falling.
					They would never make it back to base at that speed and ditching in the North Sea in February
					would have spelled certain death for the crew. The crew requested that the pilot crash land the
					aircraft rather than having the crew bail out. The pilot turned back to the Dutch coast and broke
					out of the low cloud over Amsterdam. At that point the German anti-aircraft flak opened up.
					The pilot dove to roof top level and crash landed the bomber on the first large field he saw at
					Inlaagpolder just east-southeast of Spaarndam, Netherlands. The pilot stated that there were no
					German bullet holes in the aircraft, it was simply a matter of mechanical failure  three of them!

					Named "Rain Check/Lady Winifred".  Battle damaged on a mission to the Junkers aircraft factory at
					Halberstadt, Germany 11Jan44. An enemy fighter attack after the target struck causing severe damage.
					On return, force landed at Hethel (Station 114), Norfolk. Battle damaged on a mission to the
					railway marshalling yards at Berlin, Germany 22Mar44. During the bomb run over the target,
					a flak burst disabled No.4 engine and damaged No.3. Another burst damaged No.2 engine and the
					oil pressure dropped to zero. With that propeller feathered, the plane was eased out of formation
					and started a slow descent. With only one engine operating and now in danger of overheating the
					pilot attempted to remain close to the protection of the bomber stream. At a lower altitude, engine
					power was sufficient to maintain altitude above stalling speed. A ground fog kept Luftwaffe fighters
					grounded and the bomber made it through a weather front west of Hanover. Dropping down further
					to avoid radar and setting a course avoiding flak batteries over the Netherlands. In contact with
					Air-Sea Rescue over the North Sea, the bomber made it back to force land at Leiston, (Station 373), Suffolk.
					On landing it was found that the main and emergency brakes had been shot out.
					To stop, the pilot kicked right rudder and headed for the grass and mud as the nose tipped over
					slightly before the tail settled back on the ground. The crew had nicknamed the plane 'Lady Winifred'.

					Group left Harvard Field in Nebraska for a transatlantic flight to England. Sixty arrived.
					Two were lost with their crew over the Atlantic and never found. One of them was B-17G 42-37865
					of 798th Bomb Squadron that took off on November 27, 1943 from RCAF Goose Bay, Labrador
					for a direct flight to Prestwick, Scotland. It went missing without a trace, being unaccounted
					for since radar equipment at Goose Bay lost track of it 85 miles out and on course.
					Weather conditions en route and at the terminal were considered satisfactory for the trip
					and were proved so by the successful completion of flights by two other similarly routed
					B-17s which departed the same night. No radio contact was made with the subject aircraft
					after it was cleared from the tower frequency, except that the pilot of one of the B-17s that
					completed the trip reported at Prestwick that he contacted on Channel B, VHF, an aircraft
					believed to be 42-37865 one and one half hours out of Goose Bay, which reported "everything OK".
					An aerial search was scheduled to start at daybreak the next day but a blizzard through the
					Goose Bay area prevented it being launched on 28 November (9KIS).  .MACR 1119.

 					Damaged on a mission to the industrial area at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 29Jan44.
					Lockheed P-38 Lightning escort fighters dropped their auxiliary fuel tanks too close to the
					Group formation. This bomber was struck by a fuel tank falling on the left wing which left
					a large hole in the wing and destroyed the left aileron. The pilots managed to limp back to
					base with limited controls. Damaged landing at Molesworth 24Apr44. The bomber crashed
					shortly after takeoff for a mission to Nantes, France 10Jun44, just after joining the formation.
					When last seen, the left wing dipped down and the B-17 went into a dive. The pilot brought
					it out of the dive and climbed to the level of the formation. The bomber went into a second dive
					and in to a spin. An explosion followed, apparently from the bombs, and the tail was blown off.
					The B-17 crashed one quarter of one mile southwest of Great Gidding, Huntingdonshire, England.
					Four crewmen managed to bail out but the other six died in the crash. Salvaged 2nd Strategic

					(2KIA:8POW). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and a
					recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division,
					continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy
					fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration
					and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal support but
					they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for themselves
					on the return trip. It proved to be the most disastrous of the 303rd Bomb Group combat missions
					flown to date. The 303rd lost eleven of the forty B-17s flying the mission. Luftwaffe attacks
					started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when the American fighters returned home.
					Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run, with intermittent inaccurate
					flak on the return trip. Enemy aircraft shot off tail, crashed Kirchlengern, twenty-two miles

					Quentin, France 2Aug44 (9POW). As it approached the target, an engine failed. The pilot feathered the
					propeller and continued on the bomb run but fell behind the formation and was losing altitude. The
					anti-aircraft fire was heavy at this time, the plane took a direct hit and lost another engine. After
					dropping its bombs, it was still losing altitude, the pilot ordered the crew to lighten the plane and
					throw everything out. He told the crew that he intended to ditch and ordered that the ball turret be
					jettisoned. Now down low  the crew could see gardens, rooftops, rows of cabbage etc. - they proceeded
					to get in position for ditching. As soon as they sat on the floor the plane had a direct hit from an
					anti-aircraft gun on the right side of the radio room, just above where the crew was positioned.
					Five of the crew were injured by flak shrapnel. The plane was ditched in the North Sea, the pilot
					landed so well that the crew all survived. It was late afternoon and they were about five miles
					from the coast. In their life rafts they headed out to sea towards England, which was about forty
					miles away. At daylight the next day they were out of sight of land. About twenty-four hours
					after ditching, the crew saw a boat on the horizon coming towards them from the east. There
					were two Dutch fishing boats, which came up to the life rafts. A couple of their crew members
					pulled the airmen into their boats and quickly helped them to go below deck to a small cabin to
					hide. In a very short time another boat  the German Navy  came along side and there was a
					shouting match between the fishermen and the Germans, who were angry that the Dutch had
					rescued the crew. The airmen transfered to the German boat and taken prisoner. The bomber
					had ditched in the North Sea 10km west of Cadzand, Netherlands.  MACR 7749.

					at Leverkusen, Germany 1Dec43 (2WIA:8RTD). Clouds obscured the target so the formation
					diverted to the secondary target, a non-ferrous metals works at Solingen, Germany. En route
					to the target the bomber was attacked by enemy fighters firing rockets. A 210mm rocket exploded
					in the bomb bay and a waist gunner was injured. Another fighter shot out the rudder control
					cables while a third fighter sent a rocket which disabled the hydraulic system. The fuselage was
					full of holes. By the time the bomber had reached Belgium on the return it was low on fuel.
					Attempting to make an emergency landing at an airfield in southern England, the plane was
					being cut up by other planes trying to land with their wounded so the pilot elected to fly back
					to base at Chelveston. Landing without brakes, the bomber was swung off the runway into the

					fell off. The flak burst splintered the Plexiglas nose and fragments injured the navigator.
					The bomber left the formation and lost altitude turning back towards England.

					Named "Bertie Lee"    Battle damaged on a mission to Stettin, Prussia 12Apr44 (3RTD:7POW).
					The aircraft was in a group which was attacked by a swarm of fighters. This plane was singled out
					and the fighters pressed their attacks home recklessly, completely disregarding the Allied fighter escort
					and their own intense flak. This plane was riddled from nose to tail with exploding cannon shells
					and knocked out of formation, with a large number of fighters following it down, blasting it with
					cannon fire as it descended. A cannon shell exploded in the cockpit, wounded the co-pilot,
					wrecked the instruments, and blew out the side window. The pilot was seriously and painfully
					wounded in the right thigh. Hydraulic fluid filmed over the windshield making visibility impossible,
					and smoke filled the cockpit. The controls failed to respond and 3,000ft were lost before he succeeded
					in leveling off. The radio operator informed him that the whole bomb bay was in flames as a result
					of the explosion of three cannon shells, which had ignited the incendiaries. With a full load of
					incendiaries in the bomb bay and a considerable fuel load in the tanks, the danger of fire enveloping
					the plane and the tanks exploding seemed imminent. When the emergency release lever failed to
					function, the pilot at once gave the order to bail out and seven of the crew left the plane. Seeing the
					bombardier firing the navigator's gun at the enemy planes, the pilot ordered him to bail out as the
					plane was liable to explode at any minute. When the bombardier looked for his parachute he found that
					it had been riddled with 20mm fragments and was useless. The pilot, seeing the ruined parachute,
					realized that if the plane was abandoned the bombardier would perish and decided that the only chance
					would be a crash landing. Completely disregarding his own painful and profusely bleeding wounds,
					but thinking only of the safety of the remaining crew members, he gallantly evaded the enemy,
					using violent evasive action despite the battered condition of his plane. After the plane had been under
					sustained enemy attack for fully 45 minutes, the pilot finally lost the persistent fighters in a cloud bank.
					Upon emerging, an accurate barrage of flak caused him to come down to treetop level where flak towers
					poured a continuous rain of fire on the plane. He continued into France, realizing that at any moment a
					crash landing might have to be attempted, but trying to get as far as possible to increase the escape
					possibilities if a safe landing could be achieved. The pilot flew the plane until he became exhausted
					from the loss of blood, which had formed on the floor in pools, and he lost consciousness. The co-pilot
					succeeded in reaching England and sighted an RAF airfield near the coast. The pilot finally regained
					consciousness and insisted upon taking over the controls to land the plane. The undercarriage was useless.
					The bomb bay doors were jammed open. The hydraulic system and altimeter were shot out. In addition,
					there was no airspeed indicator, the ball turret was jammed with the guns pointing downward, and the
					flaps would not respond. Despite these apparently insurmountable obstacles, he crash landed the plane
					without mishap at RAF Waltham, near Grimsby, Lincolnshire. Salvaged by 2nd Strategic Air Depot,
					Abbots Ripton.  MACR 3818

					(5KIA:1EVD:4POW). The bombers arrived over the target on time but a combination of thick clouds, haze,

					from Podington 20May44. Thirty-six planes were scheduled to take off in groups of 12 each
					starting just before daylight. The fog was so bad they walked along the side of the planes
					to the runway. The pilots took off by 'stop watch' every 30 seconds. The high group was
					successfully airborne and the lead group started taking off. B-17G 42-32001 was the 7th in
					this group. Apparently its tail wheel unlocked during roll off and the B-17 veered off the runway.
					The pilot attempted to get corrected and pulled back onto the runway, but just as it
					began to get airborne, the bomber struck part of a concrete wall, and then crashed
					just beyond the edge of the runway. The B-17's load of bombs detonated, killing all the
					crew aboard. The next B-17 in line, 42-37934, had begun its run but stopped approximately
					half way down the runway, apparently having seen the red warning flares fired by the
					runway controller and heard the radio order from the control tower to stop takeoff.
					The pilot turned his plane around and started back up the runway, but the following bomber
					in line, B-17G 42-97489 did not stop its run. Presumably the pilot could not see the
					flares through the low hanging fog, and when he did see the other Fortress, it was far too late.
					The aircraft collided head on and burst into flames. Five crew members managed to escape
					from each plane, all being near the rear, before the first of five terrific explosions began,
					about three minutes after the collision. The final explosion was the aircraft which had
					been the first to crash. All aircraft were carrying 6x 1000lb GP bombs. Eleven officers
					and nine enlisted men were killed out right, and one officer died the following day. Four enlisted
					men were severely injured, and the five other midly injured. The three aircraft were completely destroyed

					Attacked by enemy fighters, 20mm cannon shells damaged the plane. A fire started in
					the bomb bay until extinguished by the engineer. Further hits wounded the navigator
					and co-pilot. The plane fell into a flat spin with pilot struggling at the shattered controls
					in a cockpit which was so thick with acrid smoke that he was forced to open the side window
					to peer out and see where the horizon was. Finally the plane leveled out at around 15,000ft
					enabaling the pilot to regain control and the bomb load to be jettisoned somewhere in the
					vicinity of the target. Damage assessment established that most of the instruments were
					shot out and the rudder cables severed; there was a large hole blown through the

					Failed to return from a mission to the Junkers Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory at Aschersleben,
					Germany 22Feb44 (1INJ:9RTD). On the way to the target, the formation met with the 381st Bomb Group.
					Since these planes were late following the main formation, no escort was available. Heavy cloud
					cover over the target forced the formation to divert to the industrial area of Bünde, Germany.
					The bomber formation was exposed to the attack of German fighters for over forty minutes
					without interruption, most of which were Fw 190s. The plane was hit during repeated passes
					disabling No.1 engine and causing severe damage to others. The airspeed was dropping forcing
					the plane out of formation and the pilot jettisoned the bombs. Faced with the prospect of a long flight
					back without the safety of the formation, the pilot dropped the bomber down to the ground and
					tree- topped his way towards the coast, barely able to remain flying at times. No.3 engine was
					inoperative and the propeller was windmilling. To conserve fuel, all gun barrels, ammunition
					and loose equipment were jettisoned. The bomber passed over flak towers, anti-aircraft guns
					and an army camp but was too low for them to shoot at it. When the people on the ground
					started waving at the bomber, the crew knew that they had crossed the border into
					enemy occupied Netherlands. Out over the sea and in relative safety from aerial attack and
					flak the crew assessed their predicament. It was clear they would not make it back across the
					water to England; ditching was the only option. A short time later one of the remaining engines
					quit, and another racked the plane with violent vibrations. As the plane hit the water, fifty-five miles
					from the coast of the Netherlands, the engines tore loose. The ditching was carried out successfully
					and only the co-pilot sustained any injuries. Having scrambled into their life rafts and paddled
					clear of the plane, the crew watched the bomber slide silently below the surface. They were in the water
					for about four and a half hours before Air-Sea Rescue arrived and rescued all 10 of them. {15 missions}

					on a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 manufacturing factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44
					(10RTD). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and a recall signal
					was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target.
					This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support
					was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s
					were airborne to provide withdrawal support but they obeyed the recall order to return to England
					and left the bombers to fend for themselves on the return trip. Luftwaffe attacks started over the
					IJsselmeer and intensified when the American fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly
					accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run, with intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip.
					Attacked by enemy fighters which shot out two engines and destroyed the oxygen system.
					A 20mm shell had exploded in the wings and the bomb bay doors, which had been hit, were
					partly open. Then began the chase between the crippled bomber and enemy fighters, a race
					that lasted for an hour and a half and spread over 200 miles. Two Bf 109s which tackled the
					Fortress deep inside Germany hung on until the coast was reached. Between attacks they flew
					like an escort on either side of the bomber, about 1,000 yards away. The pilot alternately dived,
					climbed, then dived again to skim along the ground, barely avoiding electric cables. Whenever possible
					he flew below tree-top level, alongside a wooded area. When he saw a village, he pulled over and
					flew down the streets, so that fighters would have to shoot into their own houses to shoot at the bomber.
					At one point they passed twenty-five feet above the crashed wreckage of another Fortress, and the tail
					gunner strafed and killed a German soldier guarding the crashed Fortress. Three times the exhausted
					crew prepared for a crash landing inside enemy territory. The bomber finally crossed the enemy
					coast so low that the flak towers had to shoot down at it. When the bomber landed in England its
					nose had been shot out, cannon shells had blown gaping holes in its wings and fuselage, and it was
					riddled from tail to nose with cannon shells, but none of the crew members were injured. The aircraft

					point at the target, the Group retained their bombs and proceeded to a secondary target, the
					railway marshalling yards at Schaarbeek, Brussels, Belgium. With poor visibility, a short bomb
					run was made at 18,000ft; flak was moderate and accurate. As the plane flew around
					Brussels, flak damaged No.2 engine and set fire to the cockpit. The crew bailed out and the
					aircraft exploded. It dived in the direction of Asse, but then made a left turn to disappear
					behind the houses and trees of Asse Dorp. A witness living in the Sin-Godardusstraat in Bekkerzeel
					was standing at the gate when he saw that the plane had been hit and watched the crew leave the
					plane with their parachutes. When it started to dive down he called his wife outside with their son
					because he knew from experience that it is safer outside at such times than inside. When he saw the
					plane make a turn and head straight for them, he pushed his wife and son into the canal and then
					jumped in while keeping an eye on the crashing plane. Just above the municipality of Bekkerzeel, the plane

					and taking stock of the situation and his chances of a return to base. He turned the aircraft around
					and began the long haul of over 900 miles back to England, now on its own at considerably lower
					altitude and crippled. For nearly six hours the pilot coerced his ailing bomber across the Bay of
					Biscay and the English Channel, transferring fuel from tank to tank maintaining a state of balance
					and supply of fuel for the remaining engines. Upon crossing the English coast at Lyme Bay the
					right wing was trailing thick smoke, and the pilot may have been making for an early landing
					while his Fortress was still in one piece. They had finally made it to the safety of England; all
					he had to do now was set the burning aircraft down. At tree-top height the right wing collapsed,

					Accident returning from a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Deipholz, Germany 21Feb44 (11KIA).
					Mid-air collision with B-17G 42-31370. According to the British TV program 'Time Team', the evidence
					they uncovered from the site revealed that 42-37963 had an engine problem in the clouds and while
					trying to feather the propeller, the pilot became disoriented. He then powered the other engines to
					maximum and when coming out of the clouds, realized he was very close to crashing. So he pulled
					up hard to gain altitude, colliding with 42-31370, which cut 42-37963 in half. The front section
					continued to climb until stalling, falling back and colliding again with 42-31370 from above,
					knocking the wing off 42-31370, and both planes crashed in Reedham marshes, near Acle, Norfolk

					91st Bomb Group, Bassingbourn (Station 121), Cambridgeshire 20Dec43.  Named "My Desire"
					first combat mission 30Dec43}. Severely battle damaged on a mission to the Junkers
					Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory at Aschersleben, Germany 22Feb44 (1KIA:9RTD). On the way
					to the target, the formation met with the 381st Bomb Group. Since these planes were late following
					the main formation, no escort was available. Heavy cloud cover over the target forced the formation
					to divert to the industrial area of Bünde, Germany. The bomber formation was exposed to the attack
					of German fighters for over forty minutes without interruption, most of which were Fw 190s.
					Fighters struck the plane head-on and fatally wounded the bombardier. Failed to return from a
					mission to industrial areas of Berlin, Germany 3Mar44 (5MIA:5RTD). Deteriorating weather
					conditions and dense contrails forced the formation to divert to an alternate target of the industrial
					and port areas at Wilhelmshaven, Germany. Flak damaged engine No.2, so dropped back and headed
					home but hit again by flak, damaging engine No.3. Finally, the bomber got out of the gunners range
					and was out over the sea. The pilot took stock of the possibilities of reaching England. Two engines
					were out and the propellers were windmillling which cut the speed down to 115 miles per hour, even
					when using full power on the other two engines. This meant that it was only able to maintain a
					speed of 5mph over landing speed and this could be done only by using full emergency power,
					which is supposed to be used only five minutes at a time. He knew that it would take at least 1½ hours
					to make it to England at that speed, if the other two engines held up. The pilot thought that they
					had maybe a 50-50 chance to make it and so called the crew and asked them if they wanted to
					take the chance. To a man, they all wanted to take their chances of getting back to England.
					The crew started throwing everything that they could overboard: guns, ammunition, flak suits,
					parachutes, flak helmets, all the radio equipment but one set, and everything else that they could
					get loose. By this time, the plane was down at 3,000ft and still losing altitude very gradually.
					Also, at this time it started running into low cloud banks and all of the vacuum instruments
					were inoperative because both the inboard engines, from where the vacuum instruments are
					powered, were out. All this time the pilot was having to run the two outboard engines at full
					emergency power to maintain speed and try to hold altitude. Finally the plane was down to 1,500 feet
					and only about fifteen miles from England. At this point, the No.1 engine finally burned out
					and quit. This left no choice but to crash land and at once. They had passed over a fairly large
					ship just before then and so the pilot turned around and started in for the landing. He was
					trying to land as close as possible to this ship. The sea was pretty rough, the waves had
					crests of from four to five feet but made a comparatively smooth landing. The plane did not
					break up and none of the crew members were injured. The crew could see the ship coming
					their way at full speed and there was a P-51 Mustang flying overhead showing the ship
					where they were; they were out of sight to the ship because of the high wave crests.
					The bomber floated for six minutes after it landed, then the crew had to get in the water.
					One life raft was damaged and the other destroyed. Crew members grouped around the dinghy
					that was partly inflated and held on to it but the cold water was causing hypothermia.
					The location was too shallow for the ship to come up directly alongside, and yet it was
					too deep for the plane to remain afloat. So they had to send a small row-boat over to the crew.
					The small boat was too small to carry all ten crew members in addition to the crew from the
					trawler, so it took five back to the ship. About fifteen minutes after they were picked up a
					Royal Air Force Air-Sea Rescue Supermarine Walrus amphibious aircraft arrived but found
					four bodies floating face down, the other body had already sunk. {13 missions).  MACR 3222

					Training Wing, Grand Island Field, NB 12Nov43. Fifteenth Air Force, Italy. 353rd Bomb Squadron,
					301st Bomb Group, Cerignola #1, Italy Jan44. Damaged during a mission to the harbor at
					Piraeus, Greece 11Jan44. Vertical stabiliser and rudder damaged. On that fateful day, the
					briefed mission was for the 5th Wing composed of the 2nd, 97th, 301st and 99th Bomb Groups,
					to fly on a southerly course through the heel of Italy to the town of Lecce
					where the Wing would then take a heading out over the Adriatic Sea, to a point over the
					Peloponnese peninsula of Greece. From this point the crews were briefed to complete
					a 90° degree turn to the Initial Point over Lagousa Island. From there the mission
					dictated a straight run in to the target, reassemble, and return to base. After
					the formation was organized and began making its way to the target, the Groups
					ran into a weather front of 10/10 clouds. At eighteen thousand feet they entered
					an overcast. The clouds were very thick and visibility was not much beyond the
					wingtips, making it almost impossible to see other aircraft in the formation.
					At that altitude, and with the thickness of the clouds, ice began to form on
					their wings. In such situations it was standard operating procedure for trailing
					squadrons in the formation to fly off course for a couple minutes to obtain
					some spacing from the lead squadron, which would continue to maintain its course.
					However, as the 97th Bomb Group began making a left turn for their bomb run
					on the target, the lead plane of the 342nd Bomb Squadron encountered severe
					turbulence made by the preceding elements of the Wing. The turbulence was
					so severe that the lead aircraft of the squadron was forced into a
					steep left bank before it plummeted temporarily out of control and
					lost altitude at a rate of 1,000ft per minute. By the time the pilot was
					able to recover and regain his place in formation, the two sister planes
					in the flight were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the pilots of the two
					sister planes from the flight, B-17F No.42-3251 and B-17F No.42-29918 found
					themselves alone in 10/10 visibility, unsure where the formation had
					disappeared to, with ice forming on their wings, and experiencing
					engine trouble. From what was deduced later in the accident report,
					the doomed B-17s made the decision to abort and turn back for the
					relative safety of Italy. In a tragic turn of events, their decision
					to return home took them directly into the path of the oncoming
					301st Bomb Group. According to the official report of the Board of
					Inquiry, the two B-17s of the 97th Bomb Group experienced engine
					trouble and left the formation. Instead of making a 180-degree right turn,
					away from the formation, the aircraft made a turn to the left and flew
					head-on into the 301st formation. According to a Bombardier assigned
					to the lead ship of the 301st Bomb Group, and flown by the Group
					Commanding Officer, he was startled to see a pair of 97th Bomb Group
					B-17s emerge out of a cloud about 20 degrees to the left and
					aimed straight at his aircraft. Almost Instantly, both B-17s bracketed
					his aircraft, with one passing closely over his right wing that
					clipped the vertical stabiliser, and the other closely passing
					beneath the left wing. Almost immediately, the tail gunner witnessed
					a big ball of fire that lit up the clouds as the B-17s collided
					with one fortress in the lead element, and two B-17s in the second
					element. {7 missions}. 2nd Bomb Group, Foggia #7, Amendola, Italy 1Feb44. Salvaged 8Jul44

					north with the intention of following the Baltic coast westwards. In an overcast, bad weather pushed the
					plane further north. Over Kalmar, southeast Sweden, the other engine stopped and Swedish fighters
					attempted to get the American bomber to land at Kalmar. However, with the landing strips too short,
					the aircraft continued along the coast but when the fuel was exhausted the flight ended when the pilot
					ditched in the Baltic Sea off Vållö, Mönsterås, about two miles southeast of Sandö, Sweden.
					The tail section broke off and the plane started to sink rapidly but the entire crew managed to escape
					and, despite a heavy storm, local fishermen went out and helped the Americans to safety.  MACR 4669
					After several failed attempts to locate the aircraft wreck in the 1960's and 1970's, in 1982 a fisherman

					apparently under control. Force landed in France. Regained by Group 17Dec44. Accident on return from
					a mission to the oil depot at Derben, Germany 1Jan45 (9RTD). About fifteen minutes after passing through
					flak on the German coast, the No.2 started to leak oil. The pilot watched the engine oil gauges and continued
					the sortie. Ten minutes later the oil temperature started to rise and the pressure dropped. At that point the
					pilot tried to feather the propeller. The engine vibrated, the propeller would not feather and started to windmill.
					It continued to winmill until it seized. The bomb load was jettisoned in an attempt to stay with the formation.
					The pilot could hold altitude but not speed but, being deep in Germany, followed the formation for protection.
					Near Frankfurt, the bomber was attacked by a Me 262 fighter jet but no damage was done. By now back over
					France, the No.1 engine started to run hot and rough. The power was reduced and the engine ran smoothly.
					Without charts for airfields in France, the pilot elected to continue back to England. With heavy cloud over
					southern England, the pilot headed for RAF Detling, Kent. Circling in an attempt to make contact, eventually the
					pilot made a pass over the runway as the visibility deteriorated. In low cloud, the pilot was too high on the
					first approach and was unable to correctly align with the runway and the second approach. With low fuel
					and a rough engine, coming out of low cloud for a third approach, the pilot found he was about twenty degrees
					off the runway heading. He landed and found that the runway sloped downhill delaying the plane from
					setting down. The airplane could not be stopped after landing and ran off the runway, rolling across a field,
					through an anti-aircraft pit, across a road and through a wire fence. The left wing struck a small building
					housing WAAFs then ran through a row of trees, jumped an embankment as the left landing gear hit a knoll
					which swung the bomber around. {66 missions}. Salvaged by Eighth Air Force Service Command 3Jan45

					thoroughbred racehorse widely regarded as one of the greatest racehorses of all time.
 					Failed to return from a mission to the industrial areas of Frankfurt am Main, Germany
					20Mar44 (4POW:2EVD:4KIA). High clouds frustrated bombing attempts and the squadron
					diverted to a target of opportunity. The aircraft had difficulty keeping formation. Close to the
					Initial Point a bomb-loaded aircraft, out of control, fell from the formation above, almost wiping
					out this aircraft. The pilot put the aircraft into a dive to avert collision. His quick thinking
					maneuver avoided a collision and possible explosion of the two planes that would have
					caused the loss of planes and crews. The centrifugal force rendered the crew helpless, stuck
					to the fuselage, unable to move. The aircraft was now in a rough, turbulent downdraft as the
					plane dropped over several thousand feet before the pilot was able to bring the aircraft under
					control. Now, the pilot had to regain the lost altitude to return to the group formation.
					The formation was nowhere to be found. The pilot decided to continue on to target with the
					expectation of meeting up with the group. At this time, while busy with lifesaving activity and
					observing radio silence, the pilot was unaware of the Eighth Air Force recall due to bad weather
					conditions. Navigator set the plane on course for Frankfurt. The weather cleared giving a
					visible target. Bombardier sighted the factory through his Norden bomb sight, and set the
					plane on a steady run to drop the bombs for a direct hit on target. Over the target the flak
					was heavy, accurate and intense, knocking out the two inboard engines, numbers two and three,
					and peppering the plane with a rain of steel fragments. After bomb release, the pilot took
					control and banked the aircraft away to the left from the target out of flak range only to be
					joined in the furor by attacking Bf 109 fighter planes. There were four or five of them, and their
					assault was vicious, guns and cannons blazing, determined and unrelenting. After one pass and
					doing considerable damage to the men and plane, they circled and returned for a second pass,
					this time hitting the aircraft on all sides timing their individual attacks. Bullets and 20mm cannon
					shrapnel fire was exploding all over the fuselage and ripping up the plane. Now, they attacked fast
					and at close range and caused grievous injury to the bomber and its crew. The weather cleared
					bright and German fighters continued their attacks from all directions, killing the tail-gunner
					and the top-turret gunner near Reims, France. The crew was running low on ammunition. Shrapnel hit the left-waist
					gunner in the neck, severing a neck artery. Some of the fighters bull-dogged the stricken aircraft all the way
					back to Reims, France, chewing it up for target practice, wanting to knock it out of the sky.
					The right wing was on fire. The plane was teetering from damage and loss of two engines,
					and the pilot was having difficulty keeping the plane under control. Fearing an explosion,
					the pilot gave the alarm to bail out. The plane was on fire and the pilot, again gave the
					alarm to bail. And unaware that the crew was looking after the wounded and the gunner
					trapped in the ball-turret, set the plane with two feathered engines on automatic pilot and
					bailed out behind the navigator, bombardier and co-pilot. The aircraft stalled and crashed
					near Brueil, fourteen miles west of Reims, France.  MACR 3332

					and great loss of blood he refused an offered injection of morphine. He was determined to keep his mental
					faculties clear in order that he might direct his plane out of danger and so save his comrades. Not being able
					to arise from the floor, he asked to be propped up in order to enable him to see his charts and instruments.

					returned to its base without further damage. Only when the plane had arrived in a safe area over the

					an injection of a sedative. He died shortly after being removed from the plane. Awarded the Medal of Honor.

					of an oil dump on the Seine River across from the city of Rouen, France 22Jun44. Flak was very heavy
					at the target, damaging the hydraulic system on B-17G 42-31620. The pilot brought his damaged plane
					back to base and prepared for a crash landing. When he touched down without brakes the plane
					veered to the right and hit the wing of another aircraft, and then crashed head-on into 42-38056,
					parked on its hardstand. Both caught fire immediately and were completely consumed by flames,
					shooting two and three hundred feet into the air. 0.50 caliber shells were exploding; projectiles
					and pieces of metal flew through the air. Flares were going off continually and the heat was terrific.
					Miraculously the entire crew escaped. An assistant engineering officer with the 749th and a flight
					chief raced to the scene. The wing of the first aircraft to be hit, before the head- on collision, was
					actually overlapping the fuselage of one of the burning aircraft. The fuel tanks were partially filled,
					and that if the fire developed, the aircraft would explode. Despite the difficulties encountered and
					the danger involved, the two airmen succeeded in moving the aircraft a safe distance from the fire.
					After this was accomplished, the two men returned to the scene of the fire and repeated the performance
					by moving another Fortress away from the flames. It was found later that the wing on the first aircraft
					to be taxied away had actually begun to melt. Salvaged 22Jun44

					during a training mission at Wendover 23Dec43. The 457th Bomb Group flew a 54 aircraft practice formation
					to camera bomb Omaha, Nebraska. They had fighter escorts to the target and then the fighters were to act
					as enemy attack planes on the return trip to Wendover. The mission was a success and when they landed
					back at Wendover the visiting high ranking officer wanted to see another take off and forming up of a
					six plane squadron. The 748th Squadron was chosen to make the flight. The first three planes of the
					lead element were already in place. The No.4 plane [42-31541] was forming a three plane element with
					the No.5 & No.6 planes. The three planes were racing to catch up with the lead element and came on too fast.
					It was obvious to No.5 and No.6 that No.4, flying element lead, was overshooting. Each peeled off to the right
					and left. All this was happening at about 1,500 feet. No.4 did in fact overshoot and pulled his tail up into
					the No.3 plane [42-38065]. No.1 and 2 engines immediately cut-off the tail of 42-31541. The navigator or
					bombardier in 42-38065 bailed out with no injuries and the pilot was able to land his badly damaged

					ball bearing factory at Steyr, Austria 2Apr44 (1KIA:3WIA:6RTD). After turning off the target and heading for home,
					a Ju 88 fighter approached from the rear and fired a rocket from a range of about 2,000 yards. The radio
					compartment had a hatch in the roof so the radio operator had a good view in that direction. He saw the
					rocket approach and pass over the top of the plane. Evidently it exploded just over the cockpit.
					The navigator was killed by a large piece of shrapnel that struck him in the neck. The co-pilot was
					struck in the left leg by a fairly large piece and the pilot was hit in the hand by a small piece.
					The plane returned to base and landed normally. It was rolling down the runway before the pilot
					realised that the left tire was flat. Knowing that another airplane was right behind and already
					touching down, he kept the speed up as long as he could, but saw that he would be unable to turn
					off at the end of the runway. So, he pulled off the runway to the left and the other airplane rolled on by.

					return to Amendola and broke in half. This mission produced one of the great Flying Fortress survival stories
					of the war. 2nd Lt Guy M Miller and crew of 'Sweet Pea' were approaching the target when an 88mm
					anti-aircraft shell slammed into the plane's mid-section, exploded, and nearly tore the Fortress in two.
					Huge sections of the waist on both sides instantly disappeared, control cables were cut, electrical and
					communications systems went powerless and silent. Half of the bombs fell out of the bomb bay, the
					lower turret was jammed with the gunner inside, and the explosion blew deadly debris in all directions.
					The left waist gunner, Elmer H Buss was killed instantly. The right waist gunner, James F. Maguire had
					multiple wounds but was saved by his back pack parachute serving as a flak suit, saving his life.
					The tail gunner, S/Sgt James E Totty was mortally wounded and died on the airplane. The radio operator,
					S/Sgt Anthony Ferrara was peppered like buckshot with shrapnel fragments in the chest. The stunned
					crew started its battle for survival. Lt Miller and his co-pilot, Lt Thomas M. Rybovich struggled for control
					of the airplane and begin assessing what they had left to do it with. Most of the control cables were cut
					and his major control was through use of the engines which miraculously, were undamaged. Lt. Miller
					thought about ordering bail out but decided against that when he learned he had one dead, three wounded,
					and one stuck in the ball turret. The wounded were gathered in the radio room for first aid. The
					bombardier/gunner, S/Sgt Robert R Mullen came back from the nose compartment and helped Sgt Gerald McGuire,
					upper turret gunner, bring the mortally wounded S/Sgt Totty from the tail to the radio room. McGuire did finally
					succeed in freeing Cpl William F Steuck from the ball turret. Later it was learned that turret was resting on only
					three safety fingers which were all that kept the turret from falling out of the airplane with Steuck inside.
					There were still six bombs hung up in the racks and Mullen climbed into the bomb bay and released them
					one by one with a screwdriver. Against seemingly impossible odds, Lts Miller and Rybovich now faced
					the reality of trying to nurse their mangled airplane and its battered crew across several hundred miles
					of enemy territory and almost 600 miles back to base. Navigator, 2nd Lt. Theodore Davich plotted a course
					and the pilots very gingerly set what was left of 'Sweet Pea' on the long trek homeward. Arriving back at
					Amendola, the pilot made a long, low straight-in approach and landed on a mud covered unfinished airstrip,
					landing gear down, tail wheel up. The only controls the pilot had were aileron, and a little up elevator.
					A B-17 becomes nose heavy when the throttles are retarded, and that's all the controls he had available
					to land the plane. Miraculously the landing was as good as could be expected and the tail section,
					although twisted out of shape, held together. Miller landed off the runway. The wing spar broke when the
					plane hit a drainage area, resulting in further damage. 'Sweet Pea' was repaired by 339th Service Squadron
					at Amendola. They removed the fuselage at the radio room and put on another tail section. The original pilot,
					Lt Guy M. Miller took the plane up on its next and final combat mission to railway marshalling yards at
					Blechhammer, Germany 2Dec44. {48 missions}. Group Headquarters thought that it should be retired.
					The guns and turrets were removed and made it into a transport plane. After that the plane was used as
					a hack and put onto the ferry service between Amendola and Casablanca, French Morocco. Boeing considered
					it the most damaged B-17 that ever came back after being hit while on a mission. The plane departed Amendola
					to Bari, Italy, to pick up General Strother, commander of the Fifteenth Fighter Command, for a flight to Casablanca,
					French Morocco 1Jun45. While on the landing approach at Bari, the entire left wing and the left side of the bomb
					bay caught fire. A normal landing was made and the crew safely evacuated the airplane. The fire was so intense,
					the base fire fighters could not control it, and the airplane was destroyed in a few minutes

					regarded as one of the greatest racehorses of all time,   Battle damaged on a mission to industrial areas
					in the suburbs of Berlin, Germany 4Mar44 (1WIA:9RTD). Because of severe weather in the assembly area,
					the group diverted to a target at Cologne, Germany. Intense and accurate flak at the target struck the plane
					wounding the navigator. Major battle damage on a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Metz, France 25Apr44.
					Failed to return from a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical and synthetic oil works at Leuna, Merseburg,
					Germany 2Nov44 (4POW:5KIA). The Group was hit hard after turning on the I.P. The box barrage of flak was
					heavy around the target. After the target, because of a supposedly malfunctioning compass, the Group Lead
					aircraft rallied off the target at 330 degrees west rather than 270 degrees west, as briefed. The rest of the
					Group followed the lead, in the process flying out of the protection of the main bomber stream.
					German Fighter Command had been conserving its scarce fuel for weeks so as to mount a major effort
					against the bomber attacks. An estimated 500 Luftwaffe fighters went up to meet the bomber force.
					The formation was flying at approximately 27,500 feet, about five minutes after bombing the target,
					when it was attacked by a flight of enemy fighters. The aircraft was hit in the trailing edge of the right
					wing and the empennage. Fragments came off the wing and the tail and as they came off the aircraft
					turned over on its side. There was fire in the right wing. The aircraft broke in half and crashed near
					Gnetsch, south of Bernburg, Germany. {77 missions}.   MACR 10144

					Just after the target, four bursts of flak severed control cables, destroyed the oxygen system and
					punctured No.2 and No.3 fuel tanks. The autopilot was able to keep the plane in fairly level flight
					on the way home. While the crew dealt with the carnage inside the fuselage, the engineer and co-pilot
					braced their knees against the control column while the pilot repaired the flight controls by using
					bomb arming wires and extension cords from the crew's electrically heated suits so that he had
					some control when trying to land. The crew elected to remain onboard instead of bailing out.
					The plane had been riddled with holes caused by flak shrapnel but managed to return safely to

					on the way to the target; the 20th Bomb Squadron lost all seven of its aircraft to enemy fighters.
					It was the second greatest, one day, aircraft loss for the Group but one with the greatest loss of life.
					Attacked by enemy fighters, the attack began with Fw 190s launching rockets, one of which

 					Battle damaged on a mission to an aero engine factory at Munich, Germany 16Jul44, force landed
					RAF Manston, Kent. The fuel-return line on number two engine from the carburetor overflow to the
					fuel tank was broken so there was excessive fuel consumption for that engine. The crew calculated
					that they could make it to the target and back if they could feather that engine after the target and fly
					back on three engines. To make matters worse, the sky was so full of contrails that they had to climb to
					30,200 feet for the bomb run. Then, to make things really bad, the propeller governor on number three
					engine got hit by flak and started spewing oil, so it had to be feathered immediately. That changed the
					plan to feather number two. The navigator's new calculations indicated that they could barely make the
					English coast with the number two engine operating if they left the formation and made a slow descent
					all the way home. Finally the long slow descent brought the bomber in low over the white cliffs of Dover,
					and then saw RAF Manston, Kent with a 10,000 foot long, 500 foot wide concrete strip. As the bomber
					landed and started to roll, the number two engine cut out and, as it turned off of the runway to taxy,

					shell and the pilot was wounded by shrapnel. Another engine caught fire and the plane was in a dive.
					The pilot managed to level out and assessed that only two airmen had not been injured, several too
					badly to consider bailing out. Still with the bombs on board and smoke trailing from an engine,
					the pilot attempted to return home. Eventually the engine fires were extinguished and the bombs
					jettisoned. Finally over England, a third engine stopped with fuel starvation. The badly wounded

					chemical works at Oppau, Ludwigshafen, Germany 8Sep44 (1WIA:8RTD). Just before the target, the
					co-pilot heard a click and saw a small flak hole appear in the windshield directly in front of the pilot.
					He then saw a hole in the front of the pilot's helmet and blood running down over his face. As the pilot
					pitched forward onto the control column, the co-pilot could see a hole in the back of the helmet with
					 blood streaming down the back of his neck. When the pilot fell onto the control column, he also hit
					the rudder pedal. This caused the plane to swerve to the right almost hitting another bomber. The plane
					then pitched over in to a dive. The co-pilot gained control of the aircraft after it had dropped down
					to about 12,000 feet and tried to pull it back up into formation. The pilot was not dead and came to
					about this time. Unfortunately he was completely disoriented and started struggling with his co-pilot
					to take over control of the plane. The engineer went into the cockpit, restrained Lthe pilot and moved
					him down into the nose of the plane where he lost consciousness again. The engineer and navigator r
					emoved the pilot's helmet. The piece of flak had cut a groove through the top of his skull, exposing the brain.
					Because of damage to the plane, the co-pilot could not get the plane back into formation, set a course for
					Bassingbourn and headed back alone. In a short while the pilot once again regained consciousness and
					dragged himself back into his seat. He took over the controls and flew the plane with one arm until eventually
					becoming too weak to continue. The engineer moved him back to the nose compartment and got into the
					pilot's seat to assist the co-pilot in flying the plane back to Bassingbourn. As they crossed the continental
					coast a German flak battery opened up striking the No.2 engine. On approaching Bassingbourn, it was
					discovered that the left landing gear and landing flap electrical systems had been knocked out.
					The engineer had to hand crank down the left wheel in order that they could land. The pilot survived
					but did not fly again. Failed to return from a mission to a railway viaduct at Altenbeken, Germany 26Nov44 (1KIA:8POW).
					About five minutes before the I.P. the formation was attacked by a large flight of enemy fighters.

					of vicious and persistent attacks by enemy fighters, Bf 110s from ZG 26 in particular and a
					concentrated flak barrage over the target. Despite both pilots being badly wounded (along
					with were several other members of the crew), they pulled the Fortress out of a 3,000ft dive,
					before ordering most of the crew to bail out. It was then that the wounded bombardier
					found that his parachute had been damaged, forcing him to stay aboard the B-17.
					The pilot then decided to attempt to fly the aircraft back to England, and after dodging enemy fighters
					over Germany, he descended to low altitude in order to avoid the attention of flak batteries.
					Barely airworthy, the bomber was somehow coaxed back across the North Sea, where an extremely

					The 91st Bomb Group leader had been in radio contact with a scouting force checking on weather over
				 	the target. They informed him that there was an opening at 17,000 feet. Upon receiving this information,
					the 91st Bomb Group dropped down from its briefed bombing altitude of 27,000 feet to 17,000 feet and
					went under the weather front. After leaving the target, the formation swung extra wide to the east taking it
					within range of the heavy concentration of flak batteries at nearby Leipzig. The plane was hit by flak
					with only minor damage to the aircraft. However, one small piece of shrapnel went in on the side of the
					tail, hitting and fatally wounding the tail gunner. Battle damaged on a mission to railway marshalling

					Named "Four Freedoms" .  The original crew of this plane recognized being fortunate to live in the
					United States and enjoy the four basic freedoms bestowed to every citizen: 1) The freedom of speech
					and expression everywhere in the world. 2) The freedom of every person to worship God in his
					own way everywhere in the world. 3) The freedom from want--which, translated into world terms,
					means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its
					inhabitants--everywhere in the world. 4) The freedom from fear--which, translated into world terms,
					means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion
					that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any
					neighbor--anywhere in the world. The crew was not so sure of the last freedom while flying
					combat missions! They named the plane "Four Freedoms" while they were still training in the
					United States and had the name written on the nose.  Battle damaged on a mission to the industrial
					areas of Brunswick, Germany 23Mar44 (8POW:2RTD). En route to the target, the plane was struck
					by enemy fighters which shot away the left wing tip and both left engines were damaged. Flak
					wounded a waist gunner; as the gunner was being given first aid by the bombardier, he was also
					struck by flak and wounded. Badly damaged, the two pilots were having difficulty in maintaining
					level flight. Loose equipment was throw overboard and the crew instructed to bail out; they landed
					near Eindhoven, Netherlands. The co-pilot refused to leave knowing that the pilot could not control
					the plane long enough for his own safe escape. The plane crossed the Dutch coast at about 1,200ft
					and was losing about 200ft a minute as it headed across the North Sea. The pilots brought the aircraft
