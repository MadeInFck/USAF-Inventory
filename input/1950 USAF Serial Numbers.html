					On August 23, 1995, the aircraft experienced an in-flight fire west of Rexburg, Idaho. The airplane was subsequently
					destroyed, and its private pilot/owner and safety pilot were seriously injured in the forced landing in a field
					2 miles west of Rexburg. The flight was to be a local flight out of Rexburg. The pilot-in-command reported that
					during climb out from Rexburg between 2,000 and 3,000 feet above ground level, he began to smell smoke and turned
					eastward back toward the airport. He stated: "By the time I was going east the cockpit was full of smoke."
					He opened the canopy approximately six inches to get rid of the smoke, at which point "the smoke was replaced by
					fire both inside and outside. Then there was an explosion; the top right cowling was blown off. We had shut off the
					electrical [and] fuel by this time. I had been burned on my face and hands" He stated that the fire was along the
					right side of the airplane. He dove the airplane toward the only open field for a forced landing. The pilot then
					performed a gear-up forced landing into the field. His report stated that during the landing, the tail
					skid and propeller were all that was touching the ground for the first 135 feet. The aircraft then impacted
					a ditch which put the aircraft back in the air, hit nose first, tore the engine off and flipped over, sliding backwards.

					indicated to an acquaintance at the Condor Squadron that during the upcoming flight he planned to
					practice landings at the General William J Fox Airfield in Lancaster, California. A witness, who was
					located about 1/2 mile south of the crash site, reported observing the airplane and hearing its engine
					operating. The witness stated that the airplane was flying an estimated 100 to 200 feet above the
					eastern side of the valley floor and was heading in a north-easterly direction up the canyon toward
					rising terrain. The witness further stated that within seconds he lost sight of the airplane in the low

					whilst taxying at Oshkosh, WI 4Aug03. N3518G was parked in a grass parking area behind N54RF.
					The aircraft taxied forward out of its parking spot and then initiated a right turn toward the departure runway.
					The propeller of N3518G struck the empennage of N54RF. The pilot of N3518G immediately stopped the
					aircraft and shut down the engine. Common practice at the aviation event where this incident
					occurred is for aircraft to taxi from parking spots with the aid of a marshaller and two wing walkers.
					The pilot of N3518G elected to taxi without this assistance. The pilot lost control of the aircraft
					during a gust of wind and went off the runway while attempting to land at Airpark East Airport (1F7),
					Dallas, TX 19Apr08. Before the pilot could regain control of the aircraft and return it to the runway,
					the aircraft struck a fence line with small trees and fence posts causing the aircraft to spin and
					come to a stop on the fence. Aircraft damage noted was a warped left wing, crush damage to the
					right wing, broken left main landing gear, cowling damage on the bottom of the aircraft, right aileron
					damage and damage to the propeller. Registration current [Jun20].

					stronger and gustier than expected and the airplane encountered a gust at touchdown, which placed

					hard landing at Fort Pierce, FL. Registered 10May80 as N73ED; cancelled as destroyed 4Aug84.
					Destroyed 4Aug84 at Oceanport, NJ. On climb out from second attempt to pick up a banner the engine
					reportedly failed. Aircraft stalled and impacted the ground. On engaging tow, pilot had executed full
					power pull-up to about 150 ft agl when power loss occurred. Pilot performed a forced landing on
					sandy terrain. Fire broke out on landing roll. Pilot evacuated aircraft successfully but aircraft
					was destroyed by ground fire. Investigation revealed a broken fitting at the fuel pump discharge
					port caused fuel starvation. Fire ignition occurred from fuel spillage onto hot manifold on landing
					touchdown. Rebuilt using an undocumented airframe obtained in Arizona. Registered 3Feb87 as N73ED.
					Reregistered as N305CR 24Feb06; current [Apr19]. Substantially damaged 17Oct13 when came to rest
					inverted after brake application on landing at Slatington Airport, PA. During the landing flare
					the airplane began drifting to the right. The pilot stated that he applied left rudder to
					compensate for the drift. Upon touchdown, the pilot applied the brakes and the airplane flipped
					upside down with the tail lifting up first. The airplane suffered substantial damage to the
					fuselage and vertical stabilizer. The airfield wind sock had not been properly maintained and was not accurate.
					Note: the registration marks N73ED have been reported faintly visible (in store Apr08) on the Bird Dog
					which arrived at the USS Midway Museum, San Diego 24Oct06, and which was later repainted to represent
					SVNAF 14981 'FDD' (the aircraft which landed on USS Midway), and put on display. It is believed that
					this airframe is the remains of the original 50-1741 restored for static display after its 1984 accident.
					The radio call sign 112206 is on the instrument panel.

					in Lebanon (UNOGIL) Jun58 to Dec58. Returned to US Army. US Army Europe (USAREUR). Returned to Cessna,
					Wichita, KS; modified to O-1G. 220th Reconnaissance Airplane Company (RAC) "Catkillers", Phu Bai, Hue,
					Thua Thien Hue Province, South Vietnam Mar68 to Nov69. Shot at by enemy ground fire near the DMZ,
					South Vietnam 6Jun69 [1KIA]. The aircraft had been struck by a 12.7mm round through the lower
					fuselage that entered the upper leg and forearm, blowing off the hand several inches above the
					wrist of the US Marine Corps observer. With only a few days left of his tour in Vietnam, he bled
					to death before the pilot could land for medical assistance. With blood seeping into the airframe,
					despite several attempts to steam clean, nobody would fly the aircraft because of the smell.
					After several days, one pilot took on the aircraft for his personal mount and had 'Captain Jack' painted
					on the door and 'Jack's Revenge' on the nose. Turned in to the 142nd Transportation Company (DS),
					58th Transportation Battalion, Red Beach, Da Nang Nov69. 21st Reconnaissance Airplane Company (RAC)

					Substantially damaged 8Jun10 at Toms River, NJ, when, after touchdown, a gust of wind pushed the tail
					wheel-equipped airplane towards the left side of the runway. In an attempt to correct the drift,
					the pilot applied right rudder and right brake. The check pilot, seated in the rear, added power
					which resulted in a ground loop. The airplane continued its turn, about 150 feet from the runway surface,
					until the left main landing gear dug into the ground and sheared off.

50-1842			Hughes XH-17
				Kellett was awarded a contract to build a ground test-rig for the XR-17 (which became the XH-17
				in June 1948). Provision was incorporated in the contract for the modification of the ground
				rig into a flying test-stand at the Air Force option. While the XH-17 ground test-rig was under
				construction, Kellett ran into financial difficulties and in 1948 sold the rights and the partially
				completed rig to Hughes. The partially completed rig was transferred from Upper Darby, PA to
				Culver City, CA. To save costs, Hughes incorporated components from other aircraft in the
				XH-17 test-rig. The two-seat cockpit came from a Waco CG-15; landing gear came from the B-25
				and C-54; the tail rotor from a Sikorsky H-19. Ground running began on 22 December, 1949.
				Satisfactory progress was made until June 1950 when a cyclic gear failed, badly damaging
				the rig. Instead of repairing the rig, Hughes incorporated changes required to prepare
				the XH-17 for flight. Ground testing resumed after a two-year hiatus during which these
				modifications were incorporated and the XH-17 was first flown at Culver City on 23 October, 1952.
				The XH-17 was repeatedly grounded while modifications were incorporated. The off and on test
				programme ended when the rotor blades reached their design life in December 1955.
