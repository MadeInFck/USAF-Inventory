					Squadron, 61st Troop Carrier Group, Twelfth Air Force, Licata, Sicily. Operated a resupply mission to
					transport ammunition for the 82nd Airborne Division to a landing zonenear Salerno, Italy 18Sep43.
					Having unloaded, the aircraft was repositioned to Sele to evacuate wounded troops. Taxying to the
					parking area, the left wing tip contacted the propeller spinner of a parked North American A-36 Apache.
					Sciacca, Sicily 6Oct43. Crashed into the flight line while it attempted a night-time take off in formation
					with two other aircraft from Sciacca, Sicily 29Dec43 [3KIA:1INJ]. There was a 90° crosswind from the
					north blowing at about 12-to-15 MPH. The aircraft was on the right wing of the 2nd element in the
					Squadron formation. The first two aircraft of the 2nd element started their takeoff and this aircraft
					seemed to linger for perhaps 30 seconds before it started its takeoff run. It apparently made a
					straight run down the right side of the airfield and started to drift to the right. The aircraft was
					about 10 feet off the ground when its wing severed the antennae mast in front of the control tower.
					The tip of the wing passed a few feet in front of the tower. After passing the control tower the
					aircraft hit C-47 ? 42-23642 of the 53rd TCS. From that point on what happened is mere
					conjecture. Presumably the aircraft cart-wheeled as one wing was seen to fly high into the air.
					In the course of the flight from there, a propeller chopped off the tail section of C-47 ? 42-24379
					of the 53rd TCS. ? 42-92067 then careened into C-47 ? 42-5684 also of the 53rd TCS.
					The aircraft then came to rest facing the direction from which it had started. At that time
					there was a flash of flame which burned for approximately 60 seconds before being extinguished
					by the crash crew. When it had come to rest the entire cabin section had been reduced to a tangled
					mass of rubble. The cabin was utterly destroyed to the forward bulkhead. Other C-47 aircraft damaged included 42-24379.

					with a further three dying from injuries received. The aircraft had been operating a scheduled international flight
					to West Africa via France. Poor weather caused the aircraft to attempt to divert. After attempts to land at a number
					of French airports, the pilot decided to return to the United Kingdom as he was running short of fuel.
				 	The aircraft crashed while attempting to land at Lympne Airport. The rear fuselage and possibly other parts
					were collected by Claude Jessett at Tinkers Park, Hadlow Down near Uckfield, probably in the 1950’s.
					It was his intention to convert it into a caravan for family holidays. Since then the rear fuselage has remained
					unconverted and derelict in the undergrowth as part of his collection of vintage steam and road vehicles.

				Apparently this unknown Miami-based company used N75T for drugs trafficking activities in Latin America
				during the early 1980s. One such flight went wrong, and the aircraft was impounded by the Colombian
				authorities at Maicao, La Guajira, Colombia. Sometime later they moved it to Bogotá, and subsequently
				donated it to the Colegio De La Salle, a school in the nortern suburbs of Bogota, Colombia.
				The aircraft arrived at the school in March 1987. It had been in storage
				at Base Aérea de Madrid for about three years, and it was towed over the road from there all the way to the
				 school, a journey of about 40 kms. The aircraft could not be donated to the school, because it was still tied
				up in legal investigations dating back to when it was confiscated as a drugs-running aircraft circa 1983.
				Officially it is therefore still owned by the Fuerza Aérea Colombiana, but they entered into an agreement with the
				school for its safe-keeping. The school will take good care of the aircraft while it is in their hands, which
				includes a repaint about every four years. Preserved and in use as a classroom at the Colegio De La Salle,

					To Marine Luchtvaartdienst (MLD) (Netherlands Naval Aviation Service) as Q-12. To Netherlands
					East Indies Navy as W-12. While on a flight from Sydney, Australia to Jakarta, Netherlands East Indies,
					the aircraft was struck by lightning and made a forced landing in a gorge near Katherine,
					320 kilometres southeast of Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia 26Mar47. All six people on
					board survived, and the cargo was undamaged. It took six weeks to get the plane out of the
					bush and to the main road where it could be towed the rest of the way. Creeks and rivers
					were the worst obstacles, necessitating levelling banks and laying wire mesh and logs
					in the beds. On one occasion, while negotiating a steep hill, the tow rope broke, and the
					plane ran down the slope, crashing into a tree and damaging the fuselage. Original plans
					were to send the plane to Sydney to be rebuilt. But the plane never made it to the New South Wales
					capital. Brisbane-based KLM Royal Dutch Airlines caught wind of the crash. It was just the
					thing they needed, the body of a plane to test out their overhauled engines. A disused aeroplane
					would be ideal for this purpose, so this aircraft was unloaded in Brisbane. The wingless
					plane spent two years there, before it was purchased by a marine plumber in 1950. He built his
					motorhome, based on a 1940 Chevrolet International KB-5 truck chassis, and had ten years
					of joy out of it before an accident left him with injuries to his legs. He could no longer drive,
					and so the van was put on ice for decades. A service engineer was called out to do some work
					at the owner's company.That's where he saw the truck and fell in love with it. When the owner
					died in 1990, the camper van was left in his Will to the service engineer. By 1995 it was ready
					to hit the road once more. The campervan is a familiar sight in the Samford Valley, just
					outside of Brisbane. Currently roadworthy with Queensland number plate VHDAK.
					Now drives around Australia as a camper.

					The aircraft was engaged on an aerial survey sortie in the foothills East of Velikonda
					range in Andhra Pradesh, India. The prevailing weather conditions over the survey
					region during the period were a cloud base varying from 600 m to 750 m.
					The pilot who was flying at an altitude of 2000 ft when he arrived at the survey area,
					most probably took a left-hand turn circumventing the highest peak in the
					area (Nisam Konda 2181 feet high) and then started to descend with the aim
					to get below the cloud base for visual flight. During the process, the pilot
					did not see a jutting out rock face on the adjacent hill, Podille Konda,
					which probably was obscured by a patch of low cloud. The aircraft collided with the
					rock face and caught fire.

					On 10Sep44 the plane flew to Melsbroek (B-58), Brussels, Belgium. The purpose was to collect
					casualties from a base hospital and bring them back to England. On board were two nurses for this
					purpose. The plane landed at Melsbroek but upon landing it had a flat tail wheel. After they
					landed the crew immediately requested a tyre replacement. After waiting two to three days for
					the replacement wheel without receiving it, the two nurses decided to hitch a ride back to
					England with whatever was leaving. On 19Sep44 a replacement wheel was flown to Melsbroek,
					but No.48 Squadron was then heavily involved in Operation Market Garden. Only on 26Sep44
					did the Commanding Officer realize that he had lost track of KG592 and its four crew.
					The appropriate flight commander and his deputy were despatched to Belgium but could not find
					any trace of the Dakota or the crew. A Court of inquiry held 14Nov44 was unable to conclude
					when the aircraft left Melsbroek or the circumstances of its disappearance. It was presumed
					to have been lost over the English Channel.

				93508 (MSN 13427) to USAAF 27May44. Ninth Air Force 25Jun44. 325th Ferrying Squadron,

					returning to England following a supply mission to the continent. Its home station, Grove near
					Wantage, was closed in and the pilot had been advised to divert to Exeter, Devon. En route he crossed
					Ramsbury (Station 469) and saw lights on the ground. He radioed Ramsbury control tower for
					instructions stating that he had insufficient fuel to reach Exeter safely. The tower told him to
					land on runway 26 and fired flares from the active runway as requested by the pilot. The pilot
					made several attempts to land but on his final approach the left wing tip hit some trees in Whitehill
					Copse causing the plane to crash into the woodland. Sadly the pilot, co-pilot and crew chief were
					killed instantly. The radio operator and assistant crew chief survived but were seriously injured. Salvaged 29Dec44.
					'On the night the co-pilot died his family was visiting his parents. That evening the blackboard he played
					with as a child fell down the stairs and into the basement. It was an impossible thing to happen.
					The copilot's mother immediately said, "Something has happened to him." They weren't notified
					of his death until January 1945, but the night the blackboard fell was the night the plane crashed!'

					Fitted with additional SCR-717 navigation and radar equipment for use as a pathfinder.
					Accident 21Jan45, struck trees on a hilltop somewhere in the area between Buxton and Ashbourne;
					The crew was on a daytime training flight from Chalgrove in Oxfordshire with four other aircraft. 
					Their route took them from Chalgrove to Bury St Edmunds and then to Wrexham where the formation
					was to break up and the five aircraft return individually. Due to bad weather the flight leader
					instructed the crews to break company short of Wrexham; at this point the crew of 42-93683
					decided to fly roughly ESE to avoid having to pass through a weather front that
					lay between them and Chalgrove. After a short time the weather closed in and the crew
					lost sight of the ground, the pilot decided to climb up to 3000ft. Shortly after starting
					the climb and having gained virtually no height the crew saw trees immediately ahead of
					them and had no time to avoid them. The trees caused minor damage to the aircraft with the
					starboard tail plane and elevator damaged along with the leading edge of the starboard wing

					Assigned to 242nd (Operational Training Unit, Very Heavy), 17th Bombardment Training Wing, Grand Island AAF, NB
					Flown by a crew of the 411th Bomb Squadron, 502nd Bomb Group
					On 26 January 1945, the crew took off to fly a simulated 3,000 mile mission to home base in Grand Island, NE.
 					The route was to a point 20 miles north of Jamaica then to the bombing range of Cayos Travieso where they
					made two runs at 9,000 feet. They then climbed to 20,000 feet by the time the aircraft reached Batista,
					remaining at this altitude while camera bombing Havana, Key West, Miami, and Morrison.
 					Soon after leaving Morrison the airplane commander foresaw the approach of a weather front, so while
					enroute to Jacksonville he climbed from 20,000 feet to 26,000 feet.
 					It was here also that he encountered severe head winds. By the time they reoriented themselves at
					Birmingham there were at 19,000 feet. They then dropped down to 8,000 feet and were about 50 to 60
					degrees North West of Kansas City when the co-pilot asked to see the readings on the fuel gauge. The fuel
					appeared alarmingly low. About ten minutes later, number one and four engines stopped so power was
					increased on number two and three engines. As they were flying over the undercast, the pilot asked the
					co-pilot to tune in the Ft. Riley range. Homing on Ft. Riley necessitated taking
 					up a heading of 180 degrees. The pilot dropped from 8,000 feet to 2,000 feet; at 3,000 feet they broke
					through the undercast. They spotted the range station and immediately thereafter number two engine cut out.
					Full boost was given to number three engine but it would not support the plane. They attempted to put down
					flaps, when a crash was inevitable, but the flaps did not appear to work. The crew had been notified by
					the co-pilot twenty minutes prior to the crash to take up crash positions so that they were in their
					proper places when the crash occurred 1 miles S of Ogden, KS. The airspeed on impact was estimated
					at 100 miles per hour. The crash cost six lives.

				93922 Delivered to USAAF 2Feb45
					Assigned to Combat Crew Training Squadron, 326th Army Air Force Base Unit, MacDill AAF, FL
					On April 24, 1945 the aircraft was scheduled for a routine cross country navigational training flight
					from MacDill Field, Florida west to a point over the Gulf of Mexico,
					then east to Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico. Aboard was the normal crew of eleven plus a Pilot Instructor
					and a Radio Instructor. The clouds en-route were forecast to be 5/10 cumulus. They departed MacDill heading
					west. At 10,000’ a slight oil leak was observed in the #3 engine; the propeller on that engine ran away,
					the oil leak became more noticeable, and smoke was reported from the engine. Attempts to feather the
					propeller failed and the engine erupted in flames. With 4000 gallons
					of aviation fuel in the wing tank the fire was very serious. Both fire extinguishers were used without
					any effect. A minute later the crew was ordered to bail out. But no one acknowledged from the rear of
					the plane. The pilot brought the plane down to 7300 feet and the crew began to bail out. Apparently
					the five men in the rear compartment of the plane never heard the “Bail out” order or could not escape
					and remained aboard the plane when it crashed into the Gulf. The wreckage of the plane was never located.
					Two survivors plus one body from the B-29 were taken to Key West Naval Hospital. The other ten B-29 crew
					members were never found.

					The aircraft was struck by flak immediately after the bomb run, peeled out of the
					formation, and headed for England. The crew had to ditch in the English Channel
					thirteen miles off the French coast. The bombardier and tail gunner were rescued,
					but the rest of the crew did not survive. The body of one waist gunner was recovered,
					but the remainder of the crew were not recovered. Shortly after the bomb run, flak
					struck the No.4 engine and then the No.1 engine; both engines cut out. The No.4 engine
					caught fire and the crew considered bailing out. The next burst of flak hit the tail
					wheel, knocking it off; the oxygen system was also disabled. Another burst of flak
					struck the left wing between the No.1 and 2 engines and almost tore it from the
					aircraft. It was held on only by about 1½ feet of the leading edge and about 1 foot of
					the trailing edge. The Engineer called and reported that there was fire between No.1 and 2
					engines in the main fuel tank. The bombardier jettisoned the bombs to reduce the
					weight of the aircraft. The pilot peeled out of formation and headed for the English Channel.
					The fire in the No.4 engine was extinguished and the crew believed they could make it back.
					Because of the lack of oxygen, they were forced down to 13,000ft. However flames
					continued to shoot out of the left wing and it became clear they could not make it home.

					Beyond Caen, France, en route to the target, the formation was attacked by enemy fighters.
					A cannon shell exploded on the left wing between the engines, disabling both engines. The propellers
					were feathered as the plane dropped out of formation. Turning back to England, the crew jettisoned
					excess weight including the ball turret. Reaching the coast north of Caen, the plane received
					more flak when the tail gunner received minor wounds. The pilot decided that trying to reach
					England on two engines was too risky but flew a way over the English Channel so that the crew
					could jettison the supply canisters without them falling into enemy hands. The pilot then turned back
					towards France to try and find one of the temporary allied fighter fields. Spotting a suitable field,
					the pilot set up an approach to land but saw red flares warning him off because the American airfield
					was under attack. Despite two dead engines on one side, the pilot was able to climb away in
					search of another landing field. The pilot finally force landed at Bazenville (B-2), France,
					a Canadian fighter strip. The crew returned to base via an American LST taking wounded and

						(first combat mission 8Jul44}. Battle damaged on a mission to a synthetic oil refinery at Magdeburg,
						Germany 12Sep44. Flak was encountered at the target and then the Group was attacked by a
						large force of enemy fighters. Battle damaged on a mission to railway marshalling yards at
						Cologne, Germany 17Oct44. Moderate to intense flak was encountered over the target. Failed
						to return from a tactical mission to front line strong points around Metz and Thionville,
						France 9Nov44 (2KIA:7RTD). One of the bomber's engines stopped functioning before the plane
						reached its target. Although they might have dropped out of formation and made for home, the pilot
						and co-pilot elected to go for the bomb run. However, the heavy bomb load was too much for the
						remaining three engines, and a cylinder head blew on one setting it on fire. In less than a minute
						the bomber was blown apart, wings vanishing in debris, the fuselage cracking into three sections.
						The pilot and co-pilot were killed, but the other seven crew men parachuted to safety landing in
						French territory. Three, the navigator, top turret gunner and waist gunner, were hit by flying debris.
						The bombardier landed three miles from the German front lines. He had been blown out of the plane's
						nose just as he was picking up his parachute. He fell unconscious for 10,000ft, came to, snapped
						on the parachute hooks, and opened it. The tail gunner went spinning in the detached tail section.
						While he was still inside his parachute opened, so he caught up the billowing silk in his arms
						and jumped clear. The radio operator was knocked flat on the floor, crawled to the edge of what
						remained of his section of the fuselage, and rolled off into space. The ball turret gunner, in his
						turret when the plane exploded, picked up his parachute less than a foot from the broken ledge,
						and climbed out while his section of the bomber was falling earthward. The waist gunner was
						blown through the side of the fuselage and didn't remember opening his parachute. The navigator
						followed the bombardier out the hole in the nose, and The engineer/top turret gunner got out the
						escape hatch just in time before the explosion. The aircraft exploded over the front lines on the
						French-German border and the wreckage crashed at Fouches, Belgium {33 missions}. Salvaged 28Nov44.

					pleaded with her husband to relieve the heavy burden of taxes he had imposed on the
					citizens of Coventry. Weary of her persistence, Leofric said he would grant her request
					if she would ride naked through the town. She ordered the people to remain indoors with
					their windows and doors barred. Loosening her long hair to cover her as a cloak, she
					mounted her waiting horse. Then she rode through the silent streets unseen by the people,
					who had obeyed her command because of their respect for her. Only one man, called Tom,
					was unable to resist the temptation to peep at the Countess (hence the term 'Peeping Tom').

					Named "The Expectant Father" Named because the pilot’s wife was due to have a baby when he
					shipped out to England. {first combat mission 9Apr44}. Failed to return from a mission to an aviation
					industry at Krepinki, Poland 11Apr44 (6POW:4KIA). As the formation approached the enemy coast
					near Stettin, it became apparent that visual bombing was impossible, because of weather conditions.
					It was decided to attack their secondary target, the Heinkel Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory at Marienehe,
					Rostock, Germany. En route to the target, a force of enemy fighters attacked. Just after bomb release
					over Rostock, the formation was attacked by a smaller force of fighters. The crew made it to the general
					area of their target, dropped their bomb load and headed back towards base. Enemy aircraft attacked
					and damaged No.1 engine with the propeller feathered, and that made them an easy target. German fighters
					attacked again and set the plane on fire. The enlisted men were forced to bail out because the entire
					aircraft behind the radio room was on fire. Three of the men landed in the water and drowned. The officers
					stayed with the plane and crash landed at Bad Doberan, seven miles west of Rostock, Germany.
					The nose cone popped off on impact and the plane plowed into the ground, practically filling the interior
					with dirt. It was later determined that the crew had missed the target; instead of the military site that
					they were supposed to hit at Rostock, they accidentally took out the local brewery. As a result, the POWs
					no longer received their beer rations at the camp. {2 missions}. MACR 3776.

					over the target the aircraft encountered very heavy and accurate flak. A push rod went through the
					side of the No.1 engine and it was throwing oil; the propeller was feathered. No.3 engine was hit by

					not stay with the formation and dropped out with two engines out and No.3 propeller windmilling. It was
					down to 23,000ft but the fire had gone out on No.2 engine but it was leaking oil. With all the power on
					the No.2 and No.4 engines, but with the No.3 engine windmilling, there was a lot of drag and it was
					losing altitude. Two hours later it was down to 15,000ft. At 15,000ft the pilot ordered the crew to
					throw everything out of the plane that they could get loose. At about this time they lost No.2 engine and
					feathered the propeller. Ditched in North Sea about six miles off Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. The pilot
					made a good landing in the water but the sea was so rough that the plane broke in two at the ball turret.
					The crew had not gotten the life rafts to release from the top of the plane where they were stored but
					finally succeeded at releasing them. By now the plane had sunk. Nobody seemed to be hurt too badly.
					After about forty minutes someone spotted a launch heading their way. As the boat came by, they threw
					over a net and lines. In no time the crew was aboard, exhausted but happy and shaking hands with all

					20th Bomb Squadron, 2nd Bomb Group, Foggia #7, Amendola, Italy 3Apr44. {first combat mission 7Apr44}.
					Failed to return from a mission to the Magyar Waggon- és Gépgyár aircraft factory at Gy?r, Hungary 13Apr44
					(3POW:7EVD). The group encountered moderate flak before they reached the target. The bombardier
					dropped the bombs over the target and the pilot made a left turn, descended a little, then headed for home.
					That was when the plane was hit. Five, twin-engine fighters approached from directly behind.
					They were in trail, which means they were lined up behind one another. The first one, who undoubtedly was
					the flight leader, hit the bomber with a lot of 20mm cannon fire. The two right engines were knocked
					out and the pilot could not keep the plane from pulling to the right, out of formation. Number four engine
					was disabled and the co-pilot shut it down and feathered the propeller. Number three engine was still
					giving some power at times, in surges, so it was kept running. The plane were falling behind the Group,
					so the leader began to ‘S,’ or gently turn to the right and then left so the plane could fly in a straight line and
					have a better chance to keep up. The navigator was wounded, the gunners said they were all right. The pilot
					asked them to check the tail gunner because he knew by the feel of the controls that there was some damage
					in the tail area. They reported that he was OK. His intercom was out. Actually he was badly hurt and was
					trying to signal them for help, but they misunderstood. The right wing was pretty well shot up, with many
					20mm holes. At least one shell had blown a basketball size hole in the inboard fuel tank and the crew could
					see gasoline sloshing out of it. The aileron was pretty badly shot up, but still had aileron control since the
					left one was OK. The plane was falling behind the Group but still had them in sight for about a mile ahead.
					The pilot was trading altitude for speed by diving slightly. He told the crew that he would try to get back as
					far as the Adriatic Sea and with two good engines, they might make it all the way home. Later, looking closely,
					the crew could see a very light blue flame coming out of the fuel tank. The flames were growing and once
					again, decision time. The pilot’s decision was that they would stay with the aircraft until they were over
					Yugoslavia, then bail out. Most of the crew did not agree with that and wanted to bail out as soon as possible.
					However, the pilot prevailed upon them and they stayed, watching the flames grow stronger and trail off the
					edge of the wing. As the situation turned out, the decision led to happy results for seven of the crew.
					After he determined that everyone was out, the pilot put the controls on auto-pilot, knowing that it would not
					hold straight, but would help. Then he pulled the two red buttons on the panel above the glare shield that
					would explode the charges in the IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) and in the bomb sight. The purpose was to
					destroy these two units so the Germans would not get them. The crew bailed out north of Požega-Slavonia.
					The bomber crashed near the border of Hungary, north of Bjelovar, Croatia, Yugoslavia. {3 missions} .MACR 3911

					course heading to Berlin, attacked by enemy fighters and bombed Magdeburg. Flak over the target
					was very accurate. Accident returning early from a mission to the railway marshalling yards
					in Brussels, Belgium 20May44. The No.1 engine failed and the pilot also reported that his
					entire electrical and hydraulic was out, thereby rendering all four superchargers useless.
					After lowering the landing gear manually, the pilot made a normal approach to the field,
					attempting to land on the long runway. Due to poor visibility and the necessity for bringing
					the aircraft in at a higher than normal rate of speed, the pilot overshoot the field.
					Pulling up, he went around again and repeated this performance. As he was going around for
					the third time, the No.1 engine caught fire, necessitating an immediate landing.
					Cutting his pattern short, the pilot came in on a shorter runway and in so doing,
					overshot the field again, landing at the intersection of the two runways. The aircraft,
					completely off the runway, and traveling at a high rate of speed, went through a
					linemen's tent, coming to rest off the edge of the field after crashing through a

					through the linemen's tent. One man was killed in the subsequent explosion. It is believed
					that the latter fatality occurred when the aircraft, striking the Nissan hut, knocked the
					man unconscious and the explosion killed him. The navigator received minor injuries and

					ollision with B-17G 42-97882 while taxying at Ridgewell 2Oct44. The rudder was beyond economical repair
					and had been pulled from its mounting on the vertical stabiliser damaging the hinge brackets. In addition the
					top half of the tail section from Station 11 rearward was cut off. This damage was repaired in record time
					and the aircraft was returned to the squadron the following day. Damaged attempting to takeoff at Ridgewell 5Oct44.
					On take off the pilot was unable to get the aircraft airborne and it crashed at the end of the runway in a ditch.
					Upon going into the ditch the aircraft nosed over damaging the chin turret and supporting members.
					When it landed on the tail, the wheel and axle were torn from their mounting. Also, when the tail landed it put a
					compressive load on the fuselage above that for which the aircraft was designed and broke it's back.
					448th Sub-Depot, Air Service Command, Ridgewell 5Oct44. In order to repair this aircraft it was necessary to
					replace the fuselage from Station 6A rearward. All four engines were pulled due to the fact the propellers had
					hit the ground. Wooden supports were built under the forward part of the fuselage and at the same time a
					cradle was built on a four wheel flat trailer, with which it was possible to simply pull the aircraft apart.
					A new fuselage section was procured from 2nd Strategic Air Depot and was placed on the same cradle as the old
					section which was removed. The tail section was merely sitting on a sand bag which enabled the men to guide
					the fuselage into position as well as a support. After the fuselage was lined up a hydraulic bomb hoist was
					put under each side of the cradle for making very exacting alignment in raising or lowering the new section.
					It should be noted that the new fuselage was stripped of both rudder and ball turret for this operation, as well
					as both stabilisers. The remainder of the work such as installing the ball turret, stabilisers and rudder,
					connecting lines and cables, and re-installing the engines and propellers was then completed. All the
					control surfaces that were installed had been removed from the old fuselage. The work on this aircraft was
					completed in 29 days, a total of 1,442 man hours expended on the project. Battle damaged on a mission to
					Germersheim, Germany 13Jan45. Force landed on the continent. {57 missions}. Salvaged.

					Failed to return from a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical works at Oppau, Ludwigshafen,
					Germany 8Sep44 (3KIA:4POW:2EVD). Before approaching the Initial Point of the bomb run,
					No.1 engine failed and the bomber began drifting behind the formation, already all alone as the
					squadron’s ‘tail-end Charlie’. Moments later No.2 engine was out and the pilot was appealing for
					fighter support as he was unable to maintain either altitude or speed. He struggled to not lose
					sight of the group and would drop his bombs with the group, if at all possible. When No.3 engine
					failed the crew jettisoned the bomb load somewhere in the vicinity of the target. They then turned for the
					fastest route towards Allied lines, heading toward Nancy, France, which was the area of the front
					lines at the time. The pilot headed into heavy cloud cover as the lone operating No.4 engine did its
					best to maintain some flight integrity. It was a losing battle, complicated further with the loss
					of most of the instruments operated by vacuum pumps in No.2 and 3 engines. The plane was going down,
					but nobody really knew how fast or how far. The plane struggled to stay alive as it wallowed
					in the murky skies. It was a wild ride with tremendous downdrafts. Then the pitot tube froze over
					so the pilot had no idea of air speed. Somewhere during this descent the bombardier chose to bail
					out and he was followed by the engineer; both went out the nose hatch. The wild ride continued for
					about 40 minutes, when a church steeple appeared just ahead. The aircraft force landed at
					Réchicourt-le-Château, between Nancy and Sarrebourg, France. The landing was so smooth,
					the other members of the crew who had huddled in the radio room for the impending crash jolts
					hardly realized they were safely on the ground. The joy of the landing was short-lived, however,
					as the crew was quickly rounded up by German soldiers. And as these soldiers were ordering the
					captured seven Americans into a truck, others were cutting branches from nearby trees in an
					effort to conceal the prized, intact B-17 from the air. {49 missions}. Captured by Luftwaffe. US fighter
					pilots had standing orders to destroy any bomber that might have survived such a crash landing.

				up. The airplane veered sideways, and due to the forward momentum, it began to skid. The pilot input right
				aileron and rudder in an effort to counteract the veer, and the airplane began moving back toward the
				centerline. As the airplane continued down the runway, the right main gear separated which resulted in the
				propeller blades and left main gear simultaneously breaking away. The airplane ground looped 180 degrees and
				came to rest. Substantially damaged in a hard landing at Smyrna Airport, TN 8Jun12. During final approach
				the pilot stated that the black rubber transfer on the runway surface confused him resulting in the
				misjudgment of the height of the airplane over the runway. The pilot realized that he was too high above the
				ground and too slow and applied full throttle to go around, however, the airplane impacted the runway,
				bounced, then skidded off to the right side of the runway resulting in substantial damage to the right wing
				and fuselage. Registration cancelled 14Aug13. Registered 5Nov13 as N232E, based in the United Kingdom,

					Damaged on a mission to the Magyar Waggon- és Gépgyár aircraft factory at Gy?r, Hungary 13Apr44
					(9POW:1RTD). A force of enemy fighter aircraft attacked the formation using rockets. A short circuit
					in the electrical system ignited a fire, caused by a leak in an oxygen line next to the wiring.
					The electricity in conjunction with the oxygen leak had formed an electrical arc which had
					burned a hole through two inches of armor plate in the bottom of the top turret. Attempts to
					put out the fire by the use of extinguishers had failed. The formation was forty-five minutes short
					of the target when ammunition began exploding and the order to bail out was given. Heading the
					airplane towards the Adriatic, the pilot waited for the crew to jump and then climbed down to
					follow them. While doing so he discovered the cause of the fire. Reaching into the flames he
					pulled the oxygen line aside causing the fire to diminish. The pilot suffered severe burns on his
					hands at this time. Standing on the flight deck he manipulated the controls while attempting to
					watch to see if the fire might flare up again. Confident that the fire was out. he re-entered the
					cockpit and prayed that fighters were not in the vicinity. Crossing the Adriatic, the pilot discovered
					that the fuel load would have to be transferred to balance the aircraft, a job usually carried out
					by the radio operator. The mechanism for this manipulation was located in the bomb bay under the
					radio room door. Placing the bomber on automatic pilot, the pilot crawled through the bomb bay,
					transferred the fuel load, returned to the cockpit and when he recognized the airfield at Bari, Italy,
					turned north to a safe landing at Amendola. The heat generated by the fire had left its mark, for a
					flak suit had been formed into a ball of steel and bullet casings had adhered themselves to the metal.
					Failed to return from a mission to the oil refinery at Schwechat, Vienna, Austria 10Sep44 (4POW:6EVD).
					No.1 and 3 engines were damaged by flak. As the formation cleared the bomb run, the squadron

					Foggia #7, Amendola, Italy 28Mar44. Equipped with a 20 millimeter cannon along with a 0.50 caliber
					machine gun in the tail. Battle damaged during a mission to the Wiener Neustädter Flugzeugwerke
					factory at Wiener Neustädt, Vienna, Austria 10May44. The plane took a hole through a propeller
					blade, lost the induction system on one engine and several holes in the fuselage. It landed in Sicily
					for a scheduled refueling stop but could not depart until a new engine had been flown in. The pilot
					on the crew was a tobacco chewing mad man. With the engine replaced, he took off to slow time
					the engine and check it out. Since the local troops had wined and dined the bomber crew, he took
					about seventeen of them for a ride and buzzed the local brothel in the town of Gela. The propeller
					oversped but no harm done. With the propeller repaired, they crewed up and headed for home,
					low enough to troll for fish. Damaged departing for a mission to the Astra-Romana refinery at
					Ploe?ti, Rumania 22Jul44 (1INJ:9RTD). It was standard practice to clear all the machine guns
					while the planes circled and climbed for altitude over the water when forming up. The bombardier
					was just getting into position to test fire the chin turret guns when there was a sharp hit on the nose
					of the Plexiglas in front of him. He felt air rushing in through a web-like hole that was now in front of
					his face. He hadn’t felt anything but blood was running down his forehead. A shell casing from the tail
					guns of the plane ahead had come through the nose and struck the bombardier. The pilot aborted the mission.
					Battle damaged on a mission to German submarines reported to be in the harbour at Genoa, Italy 4Sep44
					(1WIA:9RTD). Flak was heavy and accurate resulting in wounding of the bombardier. Battle damaged during
					a mission to a synthetic oil refinery at Blechhammer, Prussia 13Sep44 (10RTD). Flak was heavy and accurate
					causing a four-inch hole through the left wing spar plus a hole in the pilot’s window. Battle damaged
					on a mission to a synthetic oil refinery at Blechhammer, Prussia 17Oct44 (1WIA:9RTD). The ball turret
					gunner was wounded by flak shrapnel. Severely battle damaged on a mission to the south ordnance
					depot in Vienna, Austria 1Nov44 (1KIA:4POW:5RTD). Before the I.P. was reached, the No.3 engine started
					running roughly and smoking. When the bomb bay doors had been opened, the formation started pulling
					ahead, and the plane was unable to keep up. It made a right turn after passing over Vienna and dropped
					lts bombs on a railway line at a small town west of Neusiedler See. Shortly afterward, the engine got worse.
					The co-pilot hit the feathering switch, but the propeller wouldn’t feather; the oil line had broken.
					The engine was vibrating very badly, pieces of the cylinders flew out and several pieces came through
					the cockpit and nose, and the cowling came off. The propeller shaft was red hot. Five crew members
					bailed out southwest of Marcali, Hungary. The pilot’s interphone had gone out, but the co-pilot called
					the rest of the crew to stay with the plane. Shortly after this, the propeller came off, and this eliminated
					the mechanical difficulty. The plane crossed the coast near Brindisi and flew to Bari, Italy, where it force
					landed because of fuel exhaustion; returned to Amendola following day. {66 missions}. Returned to US.

					Crashed en route RCAF Goose Bay, Labrador to Nutts Corner (Station 235), Belfast, Northern Ireland 23/24 Jan44.
					The weather encountered in the mid Atlantic forced them first to climb to almost 30,000ft to avoid cloud
					and severe icing. Radio aids were unable to assist them in the poor weather with the result that upon
					arrival in Donegal Bay the pilot was forced to turn back out towards the Atlantic as a safety measure to
					avoid a possible crash into high ground. Finally, running low on fuel, with heavy icing and having
					exhausted attempts to land at RAF Eglinton, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, the captain elected to
					crash land the aircraft in the countryside at Erris head, four miles northeast of Belmullet, County Mayo, Eire.
					The crew survived the crash landing in a field but there would be one fatality from this incident, the death of
					a member of the salvage crew sent from Northern Ireland to recover the aircraft. Salvaged 25Jan44. The aircraft
					was dismantled on site. Work began on 25Jan44 and involved at first members of the Irish Air Corps.
					Later, personnel from the Royal Air Force in Northern Ireland came south with low-loaders to retrieve the B-17
					in sections. Three American technicians also assisted. These were probably all civilian employees of the
					Lockheed Overseas Corporation based at Langford Lodge in Northern Ireland; one certainly was.
					However a tragedy occurred on 18Feb44 when one of the three died in a drowning accident; he was
					washed out to sea while photographing the nearby coast. The final loads of aircraft parts left the area
					on 3Mar44 for Northern Ireland.

					issues with some of the planes' bomb bay doors, forced them to cancel their attack run after
					making two passes over the target area. The bombers attempted to make a pass on their secondary target at
					Comeilles-en-Vexin, but the dense undercast foiled their efforts once again. They next tried to locate a target
					of opportunity, but by the time they were able to pinpoint its location, it was too late for them to conduct a
					ng run. On the way back to England, extreme flak over Abbeville damaged the plane and wounding a waist gunner.
					e damaged on a mission to the Messerschmitt factory in Augsburg, Germany 16Mar44 (1WIA:9RTD).
					Strasburg, Germany to Augsburg, the bombers were attacked by Luftwaffe fighters in a running battle.
					over the target was moderate and accurate; flak en route was meagre and inaccurate. As the Group was
					passing near Nördlingen, almost forty miles north of Augsburg, the plane was struck by rockets fired by
					enemy fighters; the bombardier was wounded. Battle damaged on a mission to the Heinkel Flugzeugwerke
					aircraft factory at Oranienburg, Germany 18Apr44 (2WIA:8RTD). The bombers arrived over Oranienburg
					to find the town covered by a thick undercast. Forced to decide between abandoning the mission or
					bringing the formation down under the clouds, the air leader had the planes drop down to 17,000ft in
					order to make their attack run. The bomber encountered intense flak over Oranienburg. The co-pilot and tail
					gunner were wounded. Failed to return from a tactical mission to coastal defences at Boulogne, France
					5Jun44 (2KIA:7POW). Flak burst in bomb bay, causing a mid-air collision with B-17G 42-39887.

					Podington (Station 109), Bedfordshire 23Jan44. Crashed on takeoff 20May44. 36 planes were scheduled to take off
					in groups of 12 each starting just before daylight. The fog was so bad they walked along the side of the planes to
					the runway. The pilots took off by ‘stop watch’ every 30 seconds. The high group was successfully airborne and the
					lead group started taking off. B-17G 42-32001 was the 7th in this group. Apparently its tail wheel unlocked during
					roll off and the B-17 veered off the runway. The pilot attempted to get corrected and pulled back onto the runway,
					but just as it began to get airborne, the bomber struck part of a concrete wall, and then crashed just beyond the
					edge of the runway. The B-17’s load of bombs detonated, killing all the crew aboard. The next B-17 in line, 42-37934,
					had begun its run but stopped approximately half way down the runway, apparently having seen the red warning flares
					fired by the runway controller and heard the radio order from the control tower to stop takeoff. The pilot turned
					his plane around and started back up the runway, but the following bomber in line, B-17G 42-97489 did not stop its run.
					Presumably the pilot could not see the flares through the low hanging fog, and when he did see the other Fortress,
					it was far too late. The aircraft collided head on and burst into flames. Five crew members managed to escape from
					each plane, all being near the rear, before the first of five terrific explosions began, about three minutes after the
					collision. The final explosion was the aircraft which had been the first to crash. All aircraft were carrying 6x 1000lb GP bombs.
					Eleven officers and nine enlisted men were killed out right, and one officer died the following day. Four enlisted men
					were severely injured, and the five other midly injured. The three aircraft were completely destroyed.

					Atlantic Wing, Air Transport Command, Presque Isle Field, ME 21Dec43. Crashed on takeoff from RCAF Gander,
					Newfoundland 29Dec43 (10KIS). The bomber took off into the wind in a normal manner en route to
					Valley (Station 568), Anglesey, Wales. According to the crash report, the aircraft climbed steeply, so
					steeply that one witness remarked that the climb was similar to that of a single engine bomber rather than a B-17.
					It climbed to about 500 to 600 feet then banked to the left to turn to the south. At approximately fifteen degrees
					into the turn, the nose of the aircraft dropped suddenly. The engines did not appear to be having trouble, with
					the exception that three engines were exhausting blue flame and the No.1 engine was exhausting yellow flame.
					The aircraft was still in a turn when it crashed. Witnesses and investigators agree that the left wing touched
					first, the aircraft caught fire immediately, skidded several hundred feet, and then exploded with flames
					shooting 500 to 600 feet into the air. All crew and passengers were killed. The left wing was torn completely
					off and was about 50 feet to the left of the fuselage. The right stabiliser was found about 100 feet from
					where the aircraft first impacted the trees, and the fuselage was broken into several pieces. The nose and
					the pilot’s compartment was demolished and burned. The tail broke off, and all four engines and propellers
					were demolished or severely damaged. The crash site is now the Thomas Howe Demonstration Forest.
					It is not just a memorial to those who died in the crash, it is also used as a teaching tool. The Thomas Howe
					Demonstration Forest demonstrates the life and management of a forest. The crash site is used to teach
					visitors and school groups about how catastrophic incidents, such as a plane crash, can impact a forest by
					noting how seventy years later the area is different, but also how it has recovered.

					mission, a panel on top of the No.4 engine between the cowl flaps suddenly came loose and fell off. Going down
					the runway, first No.2 propeller overspeeds and then all of them start going. The pilot held it on the ground till
					he had 130mph and then up into the fog almost as soon as the plane was off the ground. No.2 engine oil pressure
					was dropping. The pilot hit the feathering button, nothing happened. Then the engineer noticed that the generators
					weren’t on; everything began to work with the electric power. Finally the crew restored everything back to reasonably
					near normal. The pilot finally got in formation and continued to the target. The flak wasn’t very accurate but it
					was striking the plane. First the bombardier couldn’t release the bombs. Then the element leader racked it up in
					a steep bank which almost stalled the plane out. The bombardier got the bombs away finally while the plane was
					in about a thirty degree bank about half way through the turn off the target. Shrapnel hit the door on the ball turret,
					a piece went through the nose between the bombardier and navigator and there were holes through the Tokyo fuel
					tanks in both wings; all the fuel drained out of them. When the plane returned home, the ceiling was about 300 to
					600 feet. The pilot had to make an instrument let down from about 6,000 feet and was right over the hangers when
					he first saw the airfield. Missed the runway the first time and had to go around. There were seven or eight holes
					in the right wing and engines, four in the nose, four in the left wing and four in the tail. Accident returning from a

					superchargers oversped causing a loss of power and the plane dropped back from formation. The crew was
					prepared to bail out as the pilot turned back towards England. The bombs were jettisoned but a malfunction
					occurred and some of the bombs became wedged in the open bomb bay with incendiary bombs rolling around.
					At this time four airmen bailed out then the bombs were finally freed as the pilot continued back and force
					landed at another airfield. Failed to return from a mission to the aircraft component factories in Leipzig,
					Germany 29May44 (4POW:6EVD). The Luftwaffe dispatched around forty fighters to intercept the bombers,
					their attack co-inciding with a ten-minute period when the bombers were flying without an escort.
					Arriving at the target and while under attack by the enemy fighters, the plane was in a collision with
					another B-17 in the Group and struck its tail section. Damaged by flak, when only one engine was still
					operating. the crew bailed out and the plane crashed one mile southwest of Rocquigny, twenty-two
					miles southwest of Charleville, Franc.

					The B-17 was flying from its base at Snetterton Heath to the 390th Bomb Group base at Framlingham (Station 153),
					Suffolk just after midnight 12Apr44 to lead as a PFF crew for a mission to Leipzig, Germany the following morning.
					The pilot had to fly on instruments because of the widespread blackout at night in England. The newly assigned
					navigator had no night experience and they were initally off course when flying to Framlingham so the radio-navigator
					took over and corrected the course. Witnesses on the ground saw the plane on approach to Framlingham during its
					downwind leg as the field lights came on. They also saw and heard another aircraft following it. After it had turned
					base leg, the German Me 410 night fighter of Ltn. Wolfgang Wenning Stab II./KG 51 opened up, striking the B-17.
					The pilot gave full throttle to all four engines but No.3 and No.4 engines would not respond, exacerbated by the
					loss of part of the right wing and aileron. Another burst from the German night fighter blew a hole in the left side
					of the cockpit, tore out the windshield and killing the navigator, bombardier and radio operator. Just as the bomber
					was about to cartwheel into the ground, the left wing clipped some tall trees, slewing the plane into a violent but
					level crash landing. The bomber had made a right turn past Great Glemham church and crashed into a brick wall
					surrounding Glemham House at Great Glemham, Saxmundham, Suffolk and immediately burst into flames (3KIA:9RTD,

					Cambridgeshire 27Feb44. Accident taking off from Bassingbourn 3Jun44. The plane was
					positioning to another airfield prior to operating a PFF mission. The plane had reached takeoff
					speed, its wheels were off the ground, when a truck pulling two loaded bomb trailers, emerged
					from the 2am darkness and crossed directly into its path. The plane's right landing gear
					smashed into the truck’s framework. In addition to the landing gear damage, two feet of the
					number three propeller blades were snapped off, the hydraulic system exploded and a fifteen
					feet gash was ripped in the plane's underside. Too far down the runway to abort the takeoff,
					the pilot continued his ascent and remained in the air until the bulk of the fuel had been burnt
					off then made a crash landing back at Bassingbourn. During the hours that the plane circled
					Bassingbourn before attempting the one wheel landing, the crew chief, who was flying with the
					crew, restored the plane's hydraulic system. With braking power in the left landing gear,
					co-ordination with number four engine to sustain it on the right side of the plane was possible.
					As planned, the pilot brought the plane down so that the left landing gear settled upon the surface
					of the runway while the right side, eventually settled on the grass area on the side of the runway,
					spun the plane around and came to rest on the grass. The crew chief's emergency in-flight repairs
					of the hydraulic system provided the pilot with a 40-45 mph ground loop speed instead of an
					estimated brakeless 85 mph landing. No one was injured on either the obstructing vehicle or aircraft.

					on the left wing which hit No.1 and No.2 engines and fuel tank supply lines were damaged.
					The engineer/top turret gunner was wounded by shrapnel. Fuel was leaking into the fuselage;
					the crew could do nothing to stop the leakage and were unable to drain it. With two engines on
					the right wing straining at full power, the pilot was having difficulty in controlling the
					plane as it quickly descended. The crew threw out anything they could to lighten the load.
					The crew was soaked in fuel but their efforts allowed the plane to clear the first chain of
					mountains on the route back to Italy. Fortunately – and surprisingly – the formation had
					stayed with the crippled bomber and provided much needed support when enemy fighters
					appeared and attempted to shoot down the straggler. The formation’s defensive power was
					sufficient to chase off the fighters. With a wounded airmen, the crew debated the
					possibility of bailing out. They patched up the gunner and felt more confident that he
					would survive a jump. The plane continued to fly until the two good engines overheated
					and about to fail. The crew bailed out near Jagodina, Serbia but the two pilots remained to
					keep the plane steady. With the autopilot set, they jumped out later and the plane
					crashed at Donja Mutnica, north of Niš, Serbia, Yugoslavia. The airmen were assisted by

					Sanchez was an aerial gunner on B-17s during World War II. He began his combat career with the Eighth Air
					Force, 95th Bomb Group, 334th Bomb Squadron, in the fall of 1943. After having flown the required 25 combat
					missions with the 95th Bomb Group, Sanchez volunteered to stay on, eventually flying a total of 44 combat
					missions. In the summer of 1944, he was sent home for rest and reassignment as a gunnery instructor.
					In recognition of his dedication, a B-17 was nicknamed ‘Smilin' Sandy Sanchez’ in his honor. It is the only
					known B-17 aircraft ever named for an enlisted man. After his short stay in the United States, the 23-year-old
					volunteered for what would be his third combat tour. This time he was sent to the Fifteenth Air Force in Italy
					and was assigned to the 353rd Bomb Squadron, 301st Bomb Group. T/Sgt. Sanchez volunteered for a mission
					to bomb an oil refinery at Ruhland, Germany 15Mar45, manning the top gun turret position. It would become
					the 66th and last mission for Sanchez.
					Participated in an Operation Frantic II shuttle mission to the Braunkohle-Benzin AG synthetic oil refinery at
					Schwarzheide, Ruhland, Germany 21Jun44. After the target, the bomber continued east and landed at Mirgorod
					(Station 561), Ukraine. The Germans had identified the location of the USAAF bomber force so the plane was
					moved to a fighter airfield at Kharkov, Ukraine later that evening. Operated a mission to the oil refinery and
					railway marshalling yards at Drohobycz, Poland 26Jun44, continuing on to Foggia #2, Tortorella, a Fifteenth Air
					Force base in southern Italy. Operated a mission to the railway marshaling yard and repair shops at Arad,
					Rumania 3Jul44. Operated a mission to railway marshalling yards at Beziers, France and landed back at
					Horham 5Jul44. Participated in an Operation Frantic V shuttle mission to the Flugzeugwerk Gotenhafen Kurt
					Kannenberg AG Focke Wulf assembly works at Rahmel, Gdynia, Poland 6Aug44. Battle damaged, after the target,
					the bomber continued east and landed at Poltava (Station 559), Ukraine. Operated a mission to an airfield
					at Buz?u, Rumania 8Aug44. Damaged by flak during the bomb run starting a fire under the left wing. The pilot
					dropped out of formation, later the fire extinguished and, with the crew safe, continued as planned on to Foggia #1,
					Celone, Italy, a Fifteenth Air Force base in southern Italy. Returned to England on a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield
					at Francazal, Toulouse, France 12Aug44. Participated in an Operation Frantic VII mission to drop supplies to the
					resistance forces in Warsaw, Poland 18Sep44. After the target, the bomber continued east and landed at Poltava
					(Station 559), Ukraine. Operated a mission to the railway marshalling yards at Szolnok, Hungary 19Sep44 (4POW).
					Struck by flak and caught fire near Szolnok, Hungary. Four of the crew bailed out and became POWs. The aircraft
					fire went out, the aircraft continued on to land at a Fifteenth Air Force base in southern Italy. Fifteenth Air Force, Italy.

					352nd Bomb Squadron, 301st Bomb Group, Foggia #8 (Longskirt), Lucera, Italy 28Oct44. Failed to return from a
					mission to the Braunkohle-Benzin AG synthetic oil refinery at Schwarzheide, Ruhland, Germany 15Mar45 (9POW:1KIA - Sanchez).
					A few miles from bomb release, the flight came under heavy flak and fighter attack. Severely damaged by flak, No.2 engine
					quit, but instead of feathering, the propeller began windmilling. Fire broke out and rapidly spread along the entire wing.
					The pilot steadied the aircraft, gave the order to bail out, and then dropped through the forward escape hatch.
					Nine crewman bailed out, but Sanchez was still in the top turret. The aircraft suddenly pitched up, rolled to the left,
					flipped over on its back, and exploded in a blinding flash. MACR 12834. . Sanchez's body was never recovered. Six weeks later,
					the war in Europe came to an end. Part of the tail section was found near Bad Muskau, Germany in 1993 in use as a
					farmer’s shed. It was recovered by the 52nd Equipment Maintenance Squadron and placed in the US Air Force Museum
					15Mar96. Displayed in the World War II Gallery at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

					railway bridge at Pontebault, Normandy, France 11Jun44 (11MIA:1POW). The Group took off in
					terrible weather and flew to the target through squalls and even worse. They made one bomb
					run on the bridge but held their bombs, circled round into position again. After the target the
					bombers turned away towards the Channel Islands and the route back to England. The heavy
					storm clouds reached tops up to 17,500 feet, with some peaking at 21,000ft. About eight miles
					south of Guernsey, this plane led the formation through one of the taller cloudbanks. The other
					aircrews in the formation never saw it again. Local residents in Guernsey heard a tremendous
					roar and it appeared that a flight of four?engine bombers passed over at about 3,500ft and were
					visible. They were in close formation but the Germans did not open fire till they had nearly passed.
					When the flak started the bombers broke formation and went off to the west. The aircraft were just
					vanishing into the mist over Vazon Bay when there was a ball of fire from one of the planes. Although
					there was some speculation afterwards, we never knew exactly what happened, except that a few
					people, on the ground and in the air, got some severe frights. On board the bomber, the tail gunner,
					the only survivor, later reported that the cloudbank completely obscured their visibility. The pilot
					banked to the right. There was a shuddering jolt and the noise of ripping metal. It had hit another
					aircraft with its right wing. For a few seconds of chaos, this plane fell out of control but the pilot
					eventually managed to pull the B?17 out of its free?fall, and flew the aircraft level and towards the
					French coast [suspected to be Guernsey]. Suddenly, the right wing gave way dropping on land.
					The plane rolled over to the right. There was an explosion, tearing the aircraft apart. The tail gunner
					was thrown clear from the aircraft. It is believed that, travelling on a converging path, this and
					42-107199 now at about the same altitude came together at the head with #693 hitting #199.
					The manoeuvre banking right could have been an attempt to avoid the flak known to have started
					before the collision. It is not known if #199 was still piloted or if this was the wreck gliding with
					all the crew having bailed out. Local reports make mention of a wing section landing in La Route
					Du Picquerel, while a local military report states that the heavy, medium and light guns acting in
					 collaboration destroyed two of the bombers. An American Consolidated PBY Catalina, Air?Sea Rescue
					aircraft arrived at the scene forty?seven minutes after the accident and picked up the tail gunner.
					Crashed into the English Channel, three miles west of Stützpunkt Langenberg, Guernsey, Channel Islands.

					Foggia #8 (Longskirt), Lucera, Italy. Named DE-DE – artwork of a pink elephant with an upturned trunk.
					The plane was the favorite of Colonel Harding, a Commanding Officer of the 32nd Bomb Squadron; the colonel
					demanded that all his crew always wear a pink elephant emblem with an upturned trunk.
					Failed to return from a mission to a synthetic oil refinery at Blechhammer, Prussia 26Dec44 (10RTD). The
					bomber arrived at the initial point only to have to make a 360 degree turn to avoid another group.
					Half way down the bomb run, flak had peppered the nose full of holes, the plane was bouncing around
					and the bombardier asked the pilot to level the plane. By the time the aircraft cleared the target, one
					propeller was feathered, another engine was disabled, the bombsight was gone, flux gate compass was
					off, the A.F.C.E. was only half operative and the plane looked like a chunk of Swiss cheese. The pilot
					couldn't contact the rest of the group and decided he couldn't make it back to home base. He asked the
					navigator for a heading to the nearest Russian controlled territory. The plane was losing altitude and
					hard to hold on a straight course. A propeller that wouldn't feather was giving plenty of trouble and the
					plane was vibrating badly. Everyone started throwing out all the equipment they could. After flying
					about 240 kilometers, the pilot decided to land. At that moment, at least seven or eight Russian fighter
					aircraft appeared but they quickly realized that the bomber was not German. The propeller on number
					one engine was red hot and in trying to shake it off, it came back through the cowling, ripped it off,
					started the engine on fire and cut through the wing. The crew started to bail out in the vicinity of Mielic,
					Poland, a Russian controlled area three miles from the front lines. The plane was in a shallow bank,
					exploded and fell to the ground in a field near Budkovce, Czechoslovakia about 3.5 kilometers behind
					the Russian front line. MACR 10745

					for the squadron with a radar navigator. Flak at the target was heavy and accurate, wounding the radar navigator.
					He was knocked unconscious and was not able to prepare the squadron for bombing. In addition, the co-pilot
					and navigator received slight wounds. The radar navigator having recovered consciousness, the squadron
					continued on to an alternate target, the oil refinery at Moravská Ostrava a P?ívoz, Czechoslovakia.
					Failed to return from a mission to a synthetic oil refinery at Blechhammer, Prussia 26Dec44 (1WIA:9RTD).
					Struck by flak after the I.P. wounding the co-pilot, then a burst struck No.3 engine and further wounding the
					co-pilot. Just over the target, a flak burst damaged the bombsight and, after the bombs were released, another
					burst struck No.1 engine and the propeller was feathered. The plane was losing altitude and vibrating badly.
					Passing through another area of flak, the pilot finally managed to feather the No.3 propeller, reducing most
					of the vibration. Heading east and in poor visibility, at 5,000ft a town showed up and the pilot circled looking
					for a landing strip. Unable to find one, the plane crash landed behind Russian lines at Rzeszów, Poland,
					skidding to a halt and avoiding some buildings. The crew climbed out of the plane and were at once
					surrounded by Polish and Russian soldiers. They then chopped the nose of the plane off and removed the
					wounded co-pilot whom the Russians immediately rushed to a field hospital. The bomber was completely
					shot up, perforated by flak holes from the rudder to the wings and nose. All four propellers and two engines
					were completely ruined; the H2X, AFCE, bombsight, fuel tanks, control surfaces were all badly shot up... {44 missions}. .

					lines at 9,000ft and was shot at by heavy flak. The Group scattered to escape and limped home without completing
					the mission. A 40mm shell struck the No.3 engine nacelle and the engine was shut down. Then some heavy flak
					struck the left wing, losing fuel from the outer Tokyo tank and damaging the aileron. The PFF radar failed and
					flak made a hole in the radio room. The bombs were jettisoned and the pilot turned back towards Italy.
					On approach to an emergency landing ground near Rome, Italy, the landing was baulked by two B-17s which

					spun down. A sharp turn threw two crew members out of the fuselage, but they were unable to open their
					parachutes and perished. Thef other four crew members remained trapped in the fuselage by the centrifugal

					601BS [3O*C]. 603rd Bomb Squadron [N7*T]. Crashed on takeoff from Nuthampstead 15Oct44 (10KIA).
					Departing for a mission over Cologne, Germany, all four engines failed and the plane crashed into the
					moat surrounding the old Anstey castle mound behind St. George’s church, Anstey, Hertfordshire.
					Fully loaded with high-octane fuel and with a full bomb load, the wreckage burned furiously and villagers
					were evacuated. Luckily the twelve unexploded bombs were submerged in the moat and did not explode.
					They were later removed by the bomb dispersal team from the base once the moat was drained, and villagers
					were allowed to return home after two days. Salvaged by 2nd Strategic Air Depot, Abbots Ripton.

					Named "The 8 Ball Mk III". . Participated in the ‘Grapefruit’ mission to drop GB-1 glide
					bombs on a railway marshalling yard at Cologne, Germany 28May44. Failed to return from a mission
					to a synthetic oil refinery at Sterkrade, Germany 2Nov44 (1KIA:9POW). The bomber was hit by flak just
					a few seconds after bomb release in the area of the number three engine and the landing gear; the engine
					was demolished and so was the landing gear. As the crew continued its flight to try to get back to friendly
					territory, the engine was giving problems because the pilot could not feather the propeller; that was
					because they lost the hydraulics to that engine. The propeller was windmilling which is a drag when
					not powered. After a while the shaft of the engine broke and the propeller acted like a fly wheel out of
					balance. The pilot couldn't give the other engines enough power to maintain altitude because the plane
					would start to vibrate and cause rivets to pop where the wings were attached to the fuselage. The pilot
					put the plane into a glide angle just enough to maintain flying speed so that they could go as far as
					possible to try and get to friendly territory. As they were losing altitude and could not keep up with
					the group they saw two P-51s that stayed with them to protect the bomber from enemy fighters as far
					as the vicinity of Arnhem. The crew bailed out at about 500ft. near Arnhem, Netherlands, while the
					aircraft was on auto pilot. The bomber crashed intact in a meadow of a farm near the Voorstondensestraat,
					just short of the Apeldoorns Kanaal, east-northeast of Eerbeek, Netherlands. {57 missions}. The Germans
					were quickly at the scene and guarded the wreckage at first. After they had inspected the interior and
					removed the remaining machine guns and their ammunition, the wreckage was left to itself. Many civilians
					visited the location and many pieces were stripped off. After the war a scrap metal firm took away the
					remnants of the B-17

					group and continued with the mission. Battle damaged on a mission to the Siebel Flugzeugwerke aircraft
					factory at Halle, Germany 16Aug44. Close to the target, one of the engines lost power and the plane slipped
					back from the squadron. Then the formation was subjected to a determined attack by enemy fighters and
					came under attack from the rear. The oxygen system had been disabled and the crew turned to an alternate
					target to jettison the bombs. Now lighter, the plane was able to catch up with the squadron. When the oxygen
					was exhausted, the pilot dove down to skim the trees back to England. Reaching the Netherlands, the pilot
					shut down a second engine and feathered the propeller and crossed the North Sea with two engines to conserve
					fuel, landing safely at Bassingbourn. The plane had been extensively damaged. Upon taking out the fuel tanks,
					an unexploded 20mm cannon shell was found inside one. Battle damaged during a mission to industrial, oil
					and rail installations in Cologne, Germany 15Oct44 (4WIA:5RTD). En route to the target, flak was meagre and
					inaccurate. From the I.P. to the target, flak was continuous, increasing in intensity and accuracy. A burst above
					the plane sent shrapnel through the top window of the radio compartment. Another burst opened holes in the
					fuselage by the radio compartment, destroying the liaison radio set. More shrapnel came through the pilot’s
					windshield, striking the pilot on his right shoulder. He reflexively pulled back on the throttles sending the
					plane into a dive. The pilot had been spun round by the force but the co-pilot restored power to the engines
					and recovered the plane’s position in formation. Then the co-pilot was struck by flak shrapnel and briefly
					became unconscious. Another flak burst knocked the bombardier out of his seat but he recovered in time to
					release the bomb load over the target. Then a waist gunner was badly wounded. Returning from the target,
					No.1 engine lost power and No.3 engine was disabled. The No.3 propeller was feathered and the No.1 engine
					later came good again. The ground crew found that one wing spar was almost cut through. Failed to return
					from a mission to a road suspension bridge at Deutz, Cologne, Germany 14Jan45 (9RTD). Flak over the target
					was heavy and caused damage to the plane. Another burst damaged No.4 engine but the propeller could not
					be feathered. The pilot lowered the landing gear to show that he was pulling out of formation. Friendly fighters
					escorted the bomber as far as Ghent, Belgium. Over the allied front line, the plane was at 18,000 feet but losing
					altitude at one hundred feet per minute. At about 15,000 feet, the No.4 propeller began to burn off. Heating up,
					the propeller shaft bent so that the propeller was cutting into the cowling. The No.4 propeller came loose
					and took the No.3 propeller with it. No.1 engine was leaking oil and not pulling full power. At that point the
					pilot elected to force land behind allied lines on the continent and was given a heading to airfield B-53 at
					Merville, France. In poor weather and unable to find an airfield, seven of the crew bailed out. The two pilots
					remained to force land about five miles north of Denain, France. Major flak damage was evident all over the
					bomber and the ball turret had been pushed up into the fuselage during the landing. Salvaged 28Jan45. {75 missions}.

					intense. During the bomb run the bomber was struck by flak which severed the aileron and rudder controls
					throwing the aircraft out of control but the pilot managed to regain control of the disabled aircraft. He ordered the
					crew to be prepared to bail out in the event the aircraft became uncontrollable. While executing a turn the aircraft
					departed controlled flight and six of the crew bailed out at 26,000ft over the Strasbourg area in France.
					Again the pilot managed to regain control of the aircraft and continued to head westwards until the aircraft ran out of fuel.
					The remaining three crew bailed out about twelve miles southwest of Le Mans in France which was within Allied lines

					names for their plane. A short time earlier the King and Queen of England had been invited to view another American
					Eighth Air Force airfield. Some of the nose art on the B-17’s there was risqué in nature so the commanders covered
					up a lot of the planes so that the Queen would not be offended by the names or nose art on them. The crew had chosen s

					the runway. Barely clearing some trees at the end of the runway and with the landing gear still down, the pilot attempted
					to force land ahead. Hitting a hummock with the wheels, it bounced over a small stream and between two telegraph
					poles, one of which demolished a section of right wing. A grove of trees tore up the left outer wing then the left landing
					gear collapsed as the plane skidded across a ploughed field and was stopped by another tree. The crew escaped
					without injury and were back in combat the following day. {71 missions}. Salvaged 25Feb45.

					to industrial, oil and rail installations in Cologne, Germany 15Oct44 (2WIA:7RTD). During the mission the
					bomber was seriously damaged by flak on approach to the target, tearing open a large hole in the left
					waist at the ball turret and almost cutting the aircraft in two. Rudder trim and control cables were severed
					but later patch repaired to enable the plane to fly stably. Two gunners were wounded; the ball turret
					gunner was trapped in his turret. The landing gear had to be lowered manually but the plane landed
					safely on return to Bassingbourn. 441st Sub Depot, Bassingbourn. The relatively undamaged front of
					the aircraft was joined with the rear portion of 42-31405 ‘Wallaroo Mark II’ which had crash landed
					on a non-combat flight 7Aug44 and been declared salvage. Parts of 13 other aircraft were also used

					Badly battle damaged during a tactical mission to bomb a bridge at Coulanges-sur-Yonne, France 25Jun44
					(2KIA:1POW). Over Paris, on the way back from the target, a burst of flak hit the nose of the aircraft directly.
					The nose was blown completely off and the metal section was mushroomed back. The bombardier had most
					of one leg blown off, the other leg fractured, one arm fractured, and serious internal injuries. Flak continued
					to hit from then on. The aircraft vibrated tremendously. The pilot ordered the crew to prepare to bail out and,
					thinking he heard bail out, the navigator jumped. Seeing a parachute open caused the tail gunner to bail out
					as well. The pilot and co-pilot remained at their controls to keep the plane in the air. In the meantime, the
					bombardier crawled back to the escape hatch and was without oxygen. The pilot turned away from the
					formation in order to get away from the flak. No.2 and No.3 engines had been hit and were inoperative.
					The No.2 propeller wouldn’t feather and caused vibration in the aircraft. The crew was determined to get back
					to England if at all possible to save the bombardier’s life. Two of the crew finally managed to pull him back
					to the top turret. A terrific blast of cold air was coming through the plane so they tied him to the turret.
					Then they gave him morphine and tied a tourniquet around his bad leg and bandaged his other wounds.
					In the meantime, the bomber had approached the English Channel where the weather was very bad, and was
					steadily losing altitude. Arriving at the English coast, the pilot had to let down through a thin layer of clouds
					and broke out over England with poor visibility. The bomber landed safely at RAF Hunsdon, Hertfordshire although
					one tire was punctured by flak. The Bombardier had died from lack of blood before landing.

					Named "Helena". Damaged landing on return from a practice mission, the plane ran out of runway and ground
					looped at Deopham Green 28Oct44. Failed to return from a mission to the Braunkohle-Benzin AG synthetic oil
					refinery at Schwarzheide, Ruhland, Germany 19Mar45 (9RTD). Crossing the front lines the formation met some
					accurate flak and again in the Dresden area. The cloud condition was scattered, with heavy haze, so the lead
					crew decided to try to make a run on the primary target. When they got closer it was decided that there were too
					many clouds, but by this time, in order to reach the secondary target, a motor vehicle plant at Zwickau, the
					formation had to circle Ruhland. There was heavy flak all the way around, and the formation couldn't go much
					farther east because of the Russian front lines. Enemy Me 262 jet fighters attacked the formation on the bomb
					run damaging the plane and disabling two engines. The bomb load was jettisoned and the pilot headed for an
					emergency airfield in Poland. Crash landed in a field near Radomsko, Poland. Salvaged 28Mar45. Crew stayed
					with Russians until 4May45, flying back to base on a repaired B-17 from Poltava (Station 559), Ukraine.

					Failed to return from a tactical mission to front line strong points around Metz and Thionville, France 9Nov44 (4KIA:5RTD).
					Complete undercast prevented the group from conducting a visual run on the targets, and the formation diverted to the
					rail marshalling yards at Saarbrücken, Germany. Flak over the target was moderate and accurate. The aircraft was
					badly hit by flak, three of the engines caught fire and were inoperable. The fires were so fierce that they were reaching
					the tail of the stricken aircraft. Further fires within the fuselage started when flares were ignited, and this rapidly
					caught a hold. Hydraulic lines were severed and the liquid from within was jettisoned onto the burning fuselage.
					With communication lines cut and unable to contact the crew, both pilots had some difficult decisions to make.
					They had not yet reached the target, the aircraft still held its bomb load and they were deep into occupied territory.
					The crew too had suffered badly at the hands of the anti-aircraft fire. The engineer was wounded in the leg and the
					radio operator’s arm was severed below the elbow causing great pain and loss of blood. He would die very quickly
					if medical help was not found. Despite the quick thinking and application of tourniquet by fellow crew members,
					he soon passed out and fell unconscious. The pilots decided that jettisoning the injured radio operator would not
					result in his receiving medical help and so they would drop the bombs and head for the nearest allied territory
					where they could crash land. Doing this would risk not only the life of the radio operator, but that of the crew and
					themselves should the stricken aircraft explode. Over the target, they released their bombs and flew alone towards
					allied territory. Flying low over the village of Hattonville, the aircraft was seen to swerve avoiding a church and homes.
					At this point, the co-pilot personally crawled through the aircraft and instructed the crew to bail out. Three chutes
					were seen by local people, two fell to earth and the third became entangled on the stabiliser and was trapped.
					A further three were seen moments later, all these escaped. The co-pilot decided to remain with the captain and try
					to land the aircraft with the radio operator on board. With only one working engine, they brought the aircraft down
					through a series of tight turns and at only 100 feet from safety the aircraft banked and exploded. Crashing to earth
					it again suffered a second explosion and disintegrated killing all three crew members on board and the crew member
					still attached to the tail. Crashed at Hattonville, France. Salvaged 18Nov44
					Pilot and co-pilot both posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

					could not stay in formation and had to drop out to return alone. The bomber was struggling to stay in the
					air as the plane crossed over the English coast. The landing gear electrical system was out and the wheels
					had to be hand-cranked down. With no brakes the plane ground looped when it landed. The aircraft rolled

					Named LOUIE THE CREEP. Named after a character created by writer Damon Runyon (best known for the
					musical Guys and Dolls) and painted after the St Lo missions July 1944. Renamed "A Bit of Lace" .
					The bomber carried one of the most famous examples of nose art ever applied to a B-17. It was painted by
					armourer Nicholas H Fingelly of the 709th Bomb Squadron, who produced about ten artworks. Fingelly
					had been approached in October 1944 by the aircraft's pilot Lt John H Bauman after his crew wrote to
					Milton Caniff asking permission to use the 'Miss Lace' pose from his very popular Army strip cartoon,
					Male Call. Caniff was so impressed that he sent the crew a personalised 19in x 4in sketch to use as a
					master for the artwork. Fingelly took between five and six hours to paint the fetching comic strip
					character across the left nose surface of Bauman's aircraft. On board for the plane’s flight back
					to the US was Corporal Fingelly. (first combat mission 6Jul44}. An extra radio was installed Aug44
					and manned by a German expatriate for electronic surveillance. 1st Strategic Air Depot, Troston (Station 595),
					Suffolk Nov44 for repairs and modifications, including the Cheyenne tail gun mount. Regained by Group Dec44.
					Damaged landing at Rattlesden 27Dec44. Returning from a mission to industrial targets at Kassel, Germany,
					damaged in an accident with B-17G 42-107025 landing back at Rattlesden 29Jan45. Severe battle damage
					on a mission to shipyards at Kiel, Germany 4Apr45 (11RTD). Over the target, and seconds before the bomb
					release, the plane was struck by a 88mm flak shell on the tip of the left horizontal stabiliser; it was blown
					completely off along with the elevator, the left side of the vertical stabiliser was holed and the rudder fabric
					was holed by shrapnel. The tail gunner was hunched down, apparently doing something with his guns, just
					as the plane was hit. He sat bolt upright with his head swivelling left and right for a moment, and when he
					saw that the aircraft was still flying in formation he relaxed back in his seat and stayed there. The aircraft’s
					dropped somewhat lower when it lost half its tail, but kept on flying. The plane dropped out of the formation
					and the crew tried to jettison the bombs but the electrical system failed. The pilot flew north for a minute or so;
					the pilot did not want to jettison the bombs over Denmark, so he turned out over the sea, and dropped using a
					screwdriver to release the shackles. The bomber flew on, at a reduced speed, far out to sea on a west-south-west
					course. Several fighters escorted it, and, finally it was back at base, where the runway was cleared for it.
					A decision had to be made by the pilot: to bail out or land. He decided that he could safely land the plane, so
					the crew congregated to the radio room and returned home safely to Rattlesden. {82 missions}. After V-E Day,
					the 709th Squadron performed a formation flyover on May 12, 1945 photographed by English photographer,

					target with B-17G 42-107070 over the Ijsselmeer, Netherlands. #070 was accidentally rammed by #983 after it
					was caught in propeller wash. As a result #983 lost propellers and No.2 engine and a fire broke out in the left wing.

					375 patches; they covered a count of 1,300 bullet holes. The bomber also lost it's entire rudder and about
					a third of the vertical stabiliser on the same mission. Named HONORABLE PATCHES. The name was a
					creation of a mechanic’s youthful imagination. The plane had accumulated a comparatively high frequency
					of battle damage that was repaired with numerous aluminum patches. The mechanic painted all the patches
					he applied to the B-17 different colors. Failed to return from a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical and
					synthetic oil works at Leuna, Merseburg, Germany 25Nov44 (1KIA). The bomber returned from the mission
					with serious flak damage to the controls. It proved to be impossible to land it, so the pilot attempted to
					head out to the North Sea. All his crew members bailed out near Framlingham, Suffolk. When it was time
					for the pilot to bail out, the B-17 suddenly went out of control and dived into the ground, the pilot perishing in the crash.

					 On 28Jul85 the pilot took off on a test flight to check the engine after it had been inspected and the carburetor
					had been overhauled. He made a ground check and full engine run-up before taking off. Intending to stay in a
					closed traffic pattern, he took off, made a normal climb in the traffic pattern, then turned onto downwind.
					While on downwind, the engine sputtered. The pilot switched fuel tanks and pumped the throttle;
					the engine restarted but a few seconds later, it lost power again. While attempting to return to the
					runway, the pilot made a 360 degree turn to avoid a glider and to lose altitude. He stated that during the
					maneuver, he lost sight of the glider, and while trying to relocate it, he lost too much altitude.
					Subsequently, the aircraft crash landed in trees about 50 feet short of the runway. An examination revealed
					that the carburetor float had been adjusted for 0.25' of travel; the minimum travel per installation
					instructions should have been 0.50'. wreck sold to CAF; registered to American Airpower

				99103 Accepted by the USAAF 19Feb44. Ninth Air Force. 45th Air Depot Group, Grove, Berkshire. 14th Liaison Squadron,
					 Knutsford, Cheshire. Crashed during a cross-country flight from Grove to RAF Cranage, Manchester, via
					Kidderminster 17May44. After flying around numerous showers, the pilot and his observer became
					completely lost. With fuel down to five gallons and surrounded by mountainous terrain, they made a
					precautionary landing in a cultivated field about one mile west of Dolgellau on the road to Llanelltyd, Wales.
					 Unfortunately, the soil was very soft and the aircraft nosed over; both airmen escaped unhurt. The pilot,
					due to poor navigation, became hopelessly lost and due to the locality in which he found himself, became
					over-anxious. There were very few airdromes south and east from the point where he attempted his landing;
					however, RAF Llanbedr and RAF Towyn were only ten or twelve miles distant to the northwest and
					southwest. Had the pilot been properly instructed in British maps and navigation procedure, this
					accident would have been avoided. Also, had he carried out a precautionary emergency landing procedure
					and chosen a more suitable landing field, he would have prevented his aircraft from nosing over. Its fuselage
					bent and left wing crumpled, the aircraft was declared a write-off and compensation was claimed by the farmer
					for damage to his crop of young oats. Loaned to Army Ground Forces 18Jul46. Permanently transferred to Army
					 Ground Forces, Germany 28May48. Returned to US. Registered as N6407C. Registered 27Sep71 to the United

					unhurt and scrambled out of the aircraft via the escape hatch above the cockpit. The aircraft had been
					carrying Jerry cans full of fuel and seconds after they had escaped the aircraft exploded. The following

					Patton's armoured columns that were sweeping eastwards across France. A short while after
					takeoff on the return leg to Ramsbury both engines cut-out. The crew headed for a field but

					Squadron, 437th Troop Carrier Group, Ninth Air Force, Ramsbury (Station 469). Crashed at Ramsbury
					4Mar44 [3 crew + 2 paratroopers KIS]. During the evening squadrons of the 437th TCG took part in a
					simulated paratrooper mission. This aircraft was flying ? 42 in a 49 aircraft formation. The
					group encountered severe weather conditions (heavy cloud and snow) and in order to reduce
					the risk of collision split into a number of 3 aircraft elements. The separate elements then
					set course for Ramsbury and upon arrival broke formation and entered the airfield's traffic pattern.
					The pilot of this aircraft appeared to be late turning into the circuit and as a result his flight path
					took him well beyond the airfield's boundaries. He then made a timed turn which under normal
					circumstances would have brought him in to line with the runway in use. Unfortunately, although the
					bearing was correct he was about two miles south of the runway. Unaware of his error he lowered
					the undercarriage and looked in vain for the lights of the field. The ground was covered by several
					inches of snow and this may have made the pilot's judgement of height above the ground difficult.
					It is believed that he thought he was on his final approach, and after flying over open fields for some
					distance, decided to land the plane. Unfortunately instead of landing on a concrete runway the aircraft
					ploughed into trees on the eastern edge of Heron's Point wood, about 3/4 mile west of the small village
					of Chisbury, and caught fire. Salvaged 6Mar44.

					diamond formation with ‘Lilly Bell II’ in the right-hand position behind the lead aircraft. The
					formation’s destination was the northern French airfield at Denain/Pouvry (A-83) south east of Lille
					near the Belgian border. Flying below the cloud level, the formation’s route would entail clearing the
					600 foot high North Downs. The formation commander decided to lead the four aircraft up through the cloud.
					The last time this aircraft was seen it was at approximately 1,300ft and was climbing in an effort to go up
					through the overcast. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble. The pilot may have seen a gap in the cloud
					and climbed too steeply to get through it. The aircraft then either stalled and/or the load in the fuselage
					shifted rearwards leaving it momentarily vertical. It then did a tail slide dropping straight down until
					the tail surfaces developed enough lift to bring the nose down. The aircraft, now upside down, then
					dived towards the ground. At such a low height the pilot had no chance of regaining control or the crew
					any chance of bailing out. The aircraft crashed into a field about 85 yards north of Clay Lane’s present-day
					junction with Queenhythe Road at Jacobs Well, two miles north of Guildford, Surrey.

					A formation of 42 C-47 transport planes took off from Reims airfield for Operation ‘Luftwaffe’ 14Mar45,
					a practice paratroop and paradrop; these exercises were necessary for periodical qualification jumps.
					The 1st Battalion and Regimental Headquarters Company of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment,
					82nd Airborne Division was scheduled to jump. During the exercise the right hand propeller separated
					from the engine. Already flying at decreased airspeed to accommodate the paratroopers’ needs, the
					aircraft was unable to recover on its single operating engine. The rapidly sinking aircraft cut a
					swathe through the parachutists in its path. Parachutes were draped over the wings of the aircraft
					and their troopers were pinned against the aircraft as it plunged to the ground. Another paratrooper's
					parachute was snagged by the tail and he rode it to the ground; surprisingly he survived. The airplane
					crashed, killing all four crew members and six paratroopers. One of the spectators of the exercise jump
					was Marlène Dietrich. Although actually a practice jump, Dietrich, was told that it was a parade jump
					held in her honor. She fell for this little white lie and after witnessing the crash became hysterical and
					remained severely distressed. Salvaged 16Mar45.

					Carrier Squadron, 437th Troop Carrier Group, Ninth Air Force, Ramsbury (Station 469). Crashed
					after engine failure at Axford, Wiltshire 11Mar44 [2KIA]; the crew was attempting to retrieve a
					Horsa glider that had broken free in a practice mission and landed in a field nearby. On the
					morning of 11Mar44, during a routine glider tow training mission, a Horsa glider (LG891) became
					detached from its tow plane and landed in a large ploughed field just north of the small
					village of Axford. The pilot of the C-47 tow plane (who was also commanding officer of the
					83rd Troop Carrier Squadron) inspected the field and decided that it would be possible
					to pull the glider out. He flew the short distance back to Ramsbury airfield, the squadron's
					home station, and picked up a new tow rope. During the afternoon of the same day he returned
					to the field. After flying low over the field several times the pilot landed the plane without
					difficulty and attached the new tow rope. The field was only 2,600 feet in length, it had been
					recently ploughed and chain harrowed and sloped in a southerly direction towards the
					valley floor. A road and an electric power line ran along its southern boundary and,
					at the time of take off, there was a 20 mph tail wind. There followed a lengthy discussion
					between the men present as to the feasibility of pulling the glider out of the field. Despite
					doubts expressed by others the pilot was confident that the task could be easily accomplished.
					The glider pilots had installed themselves in the Horsa and were awaiting the signal to go.
					The brakes on the C-47 were released and the plane slowly picked up speed. As it became
					airborne the pilot realised that he was not going to clear the power cables and pulled back
					on the stick, causing the tail wheel to dig into the field. The plane then stalled before pitching
					into the ground, eventually coming to a rest in the River Kennet. The fuselage had broken in
					two and was facing in the direction from which it had come. Fortunately there was no fire.
					The glider pilot, although unable to see the tow aircraft through a cloud of dust, saw the
					flash of sparks as the C-47 hit the power cables and cut loose, before gliding across the
					valley to another field for a safe landing. Condemned 13Mar44.

					hit and started smoking. The aircraft immediately pulled out of the formation in a steep dive to the left.
					The dive was continued for several hundred feet, and then a steep descending spiral began. The plane
					never stopped its steep spiral, hit the ground and exploded at Turnhout, Belgium [4KIA]. MACR 9919

 					Flew into hill 2 mi N of Zeals, Wiltshire after takeoff Feb 19, 1945. Those on board were mostly

					The aircraft took off in conditions of broken cloud, with some patches down to 100 feet and
					generally overcast, a westerly wind at 10 mph and visibility of 1 to 2 miles at ground level.
					The pilot made a quarter circuit of the airfield and then set course to the north-east.
					Three minutes later whilst flying in and out of the broken cloud and whilst in level flight,
					the aircraft flew into a clump of 60-foot tall beech trees on top of a knoll. The impact
					ripped 10 feet off the port wing and the aircraft rolled to port, hit two more trees and then
					impaled itself on a cluster of four mature trees, caught fire and disintegrated, scattering
					wreckage over a distance of 300 yards on the far side of the knoll. 21 occupants killed, but pilot
					survived. Destruction of the aircraft was complete but investigation revealed the engines to
					have been at a high power setting on impact. The tragic sequel to this loss is that the pilot,
					who had been awarded the DFC for his gallantry on operations, followed a restless career afterwards
					leaving and returning to the RAF until finally joining the Foreign Service and being appointed an Assistant District

					formation flying, instrument procedures for the pilots and new crew co-ordination 23Apr44 (9KIS:2RTD).
					Two ground personnel were on board as passengers. About two hours into the sortie hydraulic fluid
					started leaking which then caught fire. The crew could not find any fire extinguishers on board – they
					had been removed from the new aircraft; being high pressure they were removed to preclude bursting
					if struck by flak. The bail out bell was rung then the pilot spiralled the plane down to about 4,000
					feet when the crew bailed out. The plane went into a climbing stall then continued in a downward
					spiral. At about 2,000 feet the plane went into a flat spin and at 1,000 feet the tail disintegrated.

					The pilot in command was allowing the co-pilot to practice first phase ‘follow-through’ landings. They had made a
					normal pattern and approach and had made two previous landings with the pilot in command at the controls.
					The third landing was being made by the co-pilot from the right seat while the captain was following through
					on the controls from the left seat. The aircraft made normal pattern and approach but appeared to bounce
					quite badly as it touched the runway. At about the 1/3 mark the left landing gear appeared to collapse and
					the aircraft spun off the left side of the runway. Crashed on the O.F. Kramer farm four miles north of
					Ardmore, OK 24Sep44 (3KIS). Nine crew members bailed out after No.1 engine blew a cylinder and caught
					on fire at around 2,000ft on the downwind leg of the landing pattern. Three of the nine who bailed out died
					in their survival attempt. The engineer accidentally dropped his chute overboard and exited the aircraft on
					the back of the co-pilot. When the co-pilot's chest chute opened, the engineer lost his grip and perished.
					The navigator's chute was only fastened on one side of the harness and failed to open properly. For some
					unknown reason, The engineer/top turret gunner was last to leave the aircraft at an altitude too low for
					the chute to fully open. The aircraft crashed nose first and exploded on impact. SOC 25Sep44.

					Ardmore Field, OK 22Jan45. Four Ardmore aircraft were flying in an echelon formation on an air-to-air
					gunnery training mission over Galveston Bay, Texas 23Feb45. The aircraft departed Ardmore
					Army Air Field and flew to the Galveston Air to Air Gunnery Practice Range at an altitude of 14,000ft
					in a diamond formation. Upon reaching the range, the formation changed to echelon, to the right
					and up. While in this formation at approximately 14,000ft, this bomber occupied number three
					position up. The gunners of each aircraft fired at the towed target as appropriate opportunities
					occurred as it flew among the four aircraft. After coming down from altitude, the co-pilot, who was
					riding in the nose of the aircraft, reported finding three holes in the right side of the navigation
					compartment. Two were on the right side rear of the navigator’s compartment and one about a foot
					and a half below the co-pilots seat. When the aircraft landed at Ardmore, damage to the Number
					three propeller and right inboard wing fairing was observed. A portion of a 50-caliber bullet and
					the butt end of a 50-caliber case were found inside the aircraft. The reason for the holes in the
					aircraft was assumed to be from the propeller striking ejected 50-caliber casings and at least one bullet.
					The damages made by the projectiles were assumed to have been the result of a problem with the
					chin turret when guns were fired in certain positions. 332nd Base Unit, Ardmore Field, OK 16Jun45.

					The plane was damaged by flak over the target and the No.2 propeller was feathered. It remained with the
					formation as they dropped down to escort the crippled 42-97653 and provided much needed support
					when enemy fighters appeared and attempted to shoot down the straggler. The formation’s defensive
					power was sufficient to chase off the fighters. The crew of #653 bailed out near Jagodina, Serbia but
					the two pilots remained to keep the plane steady. About ten minutes past this point the remainder of
					the formation scattered because of clouds that extended from approximately 6,000 feet to 18,000 feet.
					The pilot of #653 was the original and regular pilot for the crew members on #429 and wanted to be
					sure that their pilot was able to bail out safely. With the autopilot set, as the plane entered clouds,
					the two pilots jumped out north of Niš, Serbia, Yugoslavia. The pilot of #429, unable in the clouds to see
					that the two pilots had gone, continued to fly alongside the now unmanned bomber. Unfortunately they
					did not concentrate or see the mountains looming ahead. The plane crashed on a mountain at Adžine Livade,

					{first combat mission 20Apr44}. {2 missions}. Failed to return from a mission to the Dornier

					Attacked by German fighters over Stuttgart, the number three and four engines were
					disabled and the aircraft sustained two hits by 20mm cannon shells in the nose; the
					bombardier was badly wounded sustaining injuries to his face. The pilot and co-pilot
					decided the situation was critical and took the decision to leave the formation, and
					flying at an altitude of 22,000ft they headed for Switzerland. After crossing the border
					the pilot started looking for a place to land. He was letting down when six Swiss fighters
					appeared in the sky and started circling the bomber. The pilot was having trouble with
					one landing gear not extending. There were heavy gasoline fumes in the bomb bay from
					leaks in the wing tanks. The ball turret guns were straight down indicating that no one
					was in the ball turret but would scrape the runway on landing. The pilot had given the
					order to drop the ball turret. While this work was going on he flew straight over the
					Greifensee in order to drop the ball turret in the water. It’s unlikely that any gunners
					were in their position because they felt they were in safe territory. The pilot circled the
					Greifensee, a lake southeast of Dubendorf. There was an airfield located at Dubendorf,
					used by the Swiss for heavy bombers. It was apparent that the pilot intended ditching
					in the lake rather than attempt a landing on one wheel, and this was why he was dropping
					theball turret. The Swiss fighters were waggling their wings and indicating that he should
					land. He circled the lake a second time, and the Swiss fighters moved in. In the second attack,
					Fritz Kolb, a Swiss pilot flying a French-built Morane fighter, fired two rockets as a warning,
					which went unnoticed. He then attacked the plane, which immediately caught fire.
					This attack killed the badly wounded bombardier and also one of the waist gunners.
					The pilot was hoping to crash land in one of the nearby fields. Three crew successfully
					bailed out over Fällander and were interned but the pilot‘s parachute failed to open
					when he bailed out and he was killed. The navigator was rescued from the bomber
					after it crashed in the Greifensee. Four other bodies were later found floating on the lake.

					mission to the railway marshalling yard at Tempelhof, Berlin, Germany 3Feb45 (1MIA:2KIA:6RTD).
					Flak over the target was intense and accurate. Damaged by flak, the aircraft ditched in the North Sea.
					Just before the target the number three and four engines were hit by flak. The manifold pressure in
					number three went down and the oil pressure rapidly dropped, forcing the pilot to feather the propeller.
					The manifold pressure of number four fell at the same time but it was kept running. There were
					also flak holes throughout the right wing, the left Tokyo tank was hit and drained, Plexiglass
					in the nose was broken and several holes in the nose compartment of the aircraft. No-one was
					wounded by this enemy action. There was enough power to stay with the formation on into the
					target and dropped the bombs with the formation. The pilot followed the group off the target but
					was dropping behind. He was asked if he wanted a course to go to Russia but said he would try
					and make it back to England. The bomber began losing altitude about fifty to seventy-five feet
					per minute and the airspeed was too low so lost sight of the group but followed the bomber
					stream on to the coast. The plane was at approximately 17000 feet when it crossed the coast
					and received more flak but it was low and no further damage was inflicted on the aircraft.
					At this time it started losing altitude more rapidly. The crew jettisoned the flak suits, ammunition,
					guns, heavy equipment and tried to drop the ball turret but was able to get it clear. The engineer
					tried to change the amplifiers to get more manifold pressure on the number four engine.
					When the plane reached 5000 feet the pilot gave orders to prepare for ditching and threw out
					the rest of the equipment that they could. Another B-17 was flying along on the right watching
					over this plane. At about 500 feet the crew assumed their ditching position in the radio room.
					The bomber hit the water and bent in the middle slightly. The only man injured to any extent in
					the ditching was the togglier who had some broken ribs and an injured leg. The navigator had a
					sprained ankle and the tail gunner was bruised. The crew got out but had difficulty releasing
					the life rafts. Only one of them would inflate properly, the other one about half inflated.
					Some of the Mae Wests would only inflate partially also. A big wave came along and carried
					them both off so the crew was forced to swim for them. The pilot swam thirty-five to forty yards
					to reach the fartherest raft, which was partially inflated, the rest swam for the other raft.
					The radio operator never made it to the raft. The crew saw him and tried to row over but the
					waves were too high and finally lost track of him as he drifted back towards the plane.
					Five of us were in our raft and the other two hanging on the sides. The crew rowed over towards
					the pilot on the other raft. He had laid down as soon as he got on the raft and they hadn’t
					seen him move since. While rowing over there the navigator, who had been outside of the boat
					for at least thirty minutes, got the cramps and the ball turret gunner got out of the boat and
					got the navigator back up to the raft and we pulled him in. The gunner wouldn’t get back in the
					raft but stayed outside and helped push the raft along by kicking his feet in the water.
					He was in the water about forty-five minutes before we reached the other raft. Two crew got into
					the raft with the pilot when they reached it. The pilot died in the raft. The ball turret gunner
					died after rescue. The pilot, 2nd Lt Robert Clay Long, was posthumously awarded the Silver Star.

					Some meagre, inaccurate flak was experienced on the route back. Failed to return from a mission
					to an oil storage depot at Derben, Germany 8Apr45 (7KIA:2POW). With solid cloud cover, the group
					diverted to the secondary target, locomotive repair facilities at Stendal, Germany. The Germans
					had moved two railcar mounted 88mm Flak guns into Stendal the night before the raid; the
					soldiers had manned anti-aircraft guns the entire war and were skilled marksmen. Leaving the target,
					the bomber received a direct flak hit in the open bomb bay. It pulled up and veered to the right,
					climbing directly over another plane [43-38843] which had to go into a steep dive to avoid a
					mid-air collision. A bad fire was burning in the aircraft’s forward bomb bay area and the
					co-pilot was trying to climb out of the small window with his back pack on but he was caught in the
					slipstream unable to exit. The plane went into a flat spin and crashed north of Stendal just
					outside of the small village Jarchau. When the plane hit the ground, the wings and tail broke off.
					{107 missions. The bomber lay in a field. Locals in need of scarce materials for their houses,
					farm sheds, etc. began stripping the plane of aluminum panels at night. The Luftwaffe base at
					Stendal was approximately 5km from the crash site. Within days, the Russian's took control of the
					abandoned base and the wreck was a perfect target for strafing practice. The B-17 was soon stripped
					or pulverized and all but forgotten. In 1996, a farmer plowing his field hooked something.
					He discovered a buried engine. He contacted a local group who research WWII crash sites and
					they began to excavate the area. They recovered one engine, a propeller and some small
					miscellaneous pieces. The engine and pieces of the plane were taken to a small building on the

					While the crew of this plane was still in training, the pilot was married in Dalhart, Texas,
					just before going to England. He chose this name for their plane because of his newly
					married status. This name comes from the popular jazz classic 'Ain’t Misbehavin’”
					(Savin’ My Love For You) which was recorded by pianist and singer Fats Waller.
					Accident on return from a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Corme-Écluse, east of Royan,
					France 19Jun44 (10RTD). Over the target the plane was struck by flak and unable to open t
					he bomb bay doors. In poor visibility, the plane was separated from the Group and returned
					towads England with its bomb load. An engine failed and the plane lost altitude when a
					second engine failed as it crossed the English Channel. The pilot was able to restart the
					engine but it ran rough. By now over the North Sea, as it approached the English coast
					with fuel exhaustion the pilot spotted an airfield for a forced landing. Banking to the
					right to align with a runway with three engines running, one on the left and two on the
					right, in the turn with the right wing down, one of the two right engines failed.
					The two pilots were unable to bring the right wing up even with full power. The right
					wing tip struck a tree and the plane spun in, hitting the ground still with full power o
					on two engines. The bomber crash landed at Great Bricett Hall, close to Wattisham
					(Station 377), Suffolk. The No.2 engine caught fire and the fuselage had split open by
					the ball turret. The crew escaped but were knocked down when the bomb load exploded.
					After the explosion there was nothing left of the bomber at the crash site.
					The 479th Fighter Group airfield buildings had broken windows, part of a wing spar
					and propeller were embedded in the tennis court. Salvaged 21Jun44

					Named "The Ugly Duckling". Battle damaged on a mission to the shipyards at Kiel, Germany 30Aug44
					(2MIA:7RTD). The aircraft was hit by flak which started a fire. Two crew members bailed out before
					the pilot could warn them that the fire was not serious. The two men bailed out near the coast of
					Denmark, but no further report was heard of them. The fire was put out and the rest of the crew
					remained onboard. The aircraft returned to England and force landed at RAF Langham, Norfolk.
					Failed to return from a mission to the Deurag-Nerag oil refinery, Misburg, a district of Hanover,
					Germany 26Nov44 (9KIA). On the way back from the target, the aircraft was struck by flak over Ameln,
					Germany; the left inner engine was badly damaged and the propeller could not be feathered.
					Most of the crew bailed out over Ameln; the navigator and both pilots remained on board.
					The pilot intended to divert to allied territory in Belgium but, shortly thereafter, the aircraft
					became unmanageable and the bomber crashed in the IJsselmeer, Netherlands. {68 missions}.

					{first combat mission 7May44}. Battle damaged during a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical
					and synthetic oil works at Leuna, Merseburg, Germany 29Jul44. After the I.P. four flak bursts
					in front of the plane started a fire in the cockpit. One fragment struck the bombardiers helmet
					and then embedded itself in the navigator’s oxygen regulator. This caused a flash fire. The left
					oxygen system was disabled causing the pilot and bombardier to pass out. The fire had
					destroyed wiring to the cockpit instruments. The co-pilot managed to extinguish the fire and
					the crew members were resuscitated. At the time the pilot must have passed out, the aircraft
					started into a slight dive to the right passing through the low squadron which scattered to
					get out of the way. Gathering speed, it began climbing and then passed through another
					squadron, which also had to scatter. These airmen thought that everybody in the nose of the
					plane was dead and that some other member of the crew was trying to fly it. By now the
					bomber was out of formation. The crippled bomber struggled back to England. There was a
					solid cloud cover, no one knew exactly where they were nor how they were going to fly through
					the clouds without instruments. Spotting another Fortress, the pilot stuck close through
					the clouds and broke through to safely land back at base. The full extent of the cause of the
					damage became evident. When the flak hit the navigator’s regulator, the system failed to
					shut down immediately, thereby allowing an excess of pure oxygen loose in the nose.
					This was the reason the fire was intense and lasted as long as it did. Damaged during a
					mission to the I.G. Farben chemical and synthetic oil works at Leuna, Merseburg,
					Germany 11Sep44. The No.2 engine regulator failed and the propeller could not be feathered.
					Vibration from the windmilling propeller was so severe that the airplane speed was
					reduced to 100mph. Cockpit panel instruments vibrated so badly they were rendered
					inoperative. The oxygen system was depleted by the time the bomber arrived back at
					the German/French border, possibly damaged earlier by flak. With reduced speed, the
					bomber arrived back at base late, the pilot suggesting that the vibration was so severe
					that the plane “may have to be scrapped”. A photograph suggests that the propeller lost
					several inches from at least one blade with another tip curled. Damage to the left cheek
					gun was inline with the propeller. 2nd Strategic Air Depot, Abbots Ripton (Station 547),

					emergency landing ground, Suffolk 18Dec44. Battle damaged on a mission to the secondary target,
					railway marshalling yards at Augsburg, Germany 15Jan45 (1KIA:2WIA:6RTD). Flak into the target
					was meagre and inaccurate. No.2 engine was not producing power and the plane was unable to
					remain with the formation. The pilot turned back and the crew looked for an alternate target on
					which to drop their bombs. Spotting a railway locomotive hauling a train, the crew set up to
					attack. Just before bomb release, the bombardier realised that the train was on a curve and
					asked the pilot for another run where the track was straight. The plane was lined up for a
					second bomb run, the bomb bay doors were opened and was then struck by an 88mm flak shell
					between the bomb bay and the tail. The tail gunner was fatally wounded; the ball and waist
					gunners were wounded. The pilot jettisoned the bombs as the crew tended the wounded. No.3
					engine had been struck by shrapnel and lost oil so quickly that the propeller could not be
					feathered. The windmilling propeller caused severe vibration and drag. The engine became
					red hot with the friction, the plane had to slow down to reduce the vibration and was unable
					to hold altitude. A P-51 Mustang came in to provide protection as the bomber headed back to
					allied lines. The bomber crew tried to shoot off the propeller but were prevented by the safety
					limit switches. The No.2 engine, which had been ticking over, came back to life at lower altitude,
					the problem being with a supercharger. The No.3 propeller finally froze from the friction as the
					bomber made it back to land safely at Deopham Green. Accident departing on a mission to the
					railway marshalling yards at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 17Feb45 (6KIA:3RTD). The plane
					entered severe propeller wash during assembly causing the pilot to lose control. It did a

					22Jan47. Reclaimed 10Apr47. Força Aérea Portuguesa as serial 7404(2). Base Aérea Nº 4,
					Lajes Field, Terceira Island, Azores. The detachment of the USAF in Lajes Field,
					Terceira Island, Azores received 44-102732 for the flight’s weather reconnaissance.
					The aircraft was poorly equipped, without radar, defrost system or long-range fuel tanks.
					For these reasons the plane was not used, eventually being virtually abandoned. Taking
					advantage of the situation, the Portuguese established an informal pact with the Americans,
					who allowed them to use the aircraft as a source of spare parts. When the Portuguese mechanics
					inspected the plane they concluded that it was in good condition, especially the structures
					of the wings and of the fuselage, with the possibility of making it ready for flight. In fact, this
					B-17G was flown and statements by pilots that flew it state that it used the serial 7404, already
					assigned to one of four SB-17G received initially. There are statements that relate to a team
					of technicians that came from the USAF to inspect the four SB-17G received in 1947, in order to
					assess the state of conservation was compatible with the execution of a large inspection
					maintenance (IRAN - Inspect and Repair as Necessary). The USAF team considered that one of the
					planes had a degree of deterioration that did not justify the IRAN. Although not substantiated,
					the hypothesis that seems more likely is that the plane refused to IRAN would have been serial
					7404, former 44-85519, which had been written off effectively, and its registration assigned to
					the B-17 acquired by FAP. This hypothesis is reinforced with another statement, which states that
					the "new" 7404 was submitted to IRAN, carried out in the United States

					out of formation, the rear gunner was fatally wounded by a cannon shell. The pilot ordered
					jettisoning the bombs, but the badly damaged aircraft was hit by more fire from the cannons of the
					Messerschmitt fighter and ceased to be controllable. Consequently its commander decided to

					Rumania 9Jul44 (7POW:4RTD). The plane was sixty miles over the Danube river on the way to
					Ploesti, Rumania. The first indication of anything wrong was when someone reported a fuel leak.
					Smoke started coming up from the floor and at the same time the co-pilot pointed to the feathering
					buttons. The pilot didn’t know what was wrong nor which engine was causing the trouble if any
					and so delayed feathering. The co-pilot grabbed his escape kit, pushed the mixture on No.3 engine
					to ‘off’, put on his parachute and left. The pilot leaned over and saw it was No.3 engine on fire.
					The propeller was feathered and the fuel shut-off. The pilot prepared to bail out after calling
					the crew on the interphone and getting no answer. He thought that he and the engineer were
					the only ones left. At that time the engineer said to hold it. He beat the floorboards out and
					put out the fire there with an extinguisher. At that time the pilot saw the navigator in the dome;
					he hadn’t answered because he had become entangled in his cords trying to reach the fire with
					an extinguisher. The radio operator appeared in the cockpit from the radio room; he had been
					on the way forward and hadn’t heard the call. With the fire out, the engineer took the place as
					co-pilot. Within sight of the Yugoslavian coast at 10,000ft, the plane ran into flak which it couldn’t
					seem to get out of. The rest of the trip was uneventful and landed safely back at Tortorella.
					Salvaged 23Sep44. Returned to Group 4Oct44. {57 missions}. Accident on takeoff when the right

					Returning from a bomber escort mission to Rechlin, north-eastern Germany, the fighter force landed at Lomma,

					completely near the target; he was able to restart it but not at full power and with subsequent severe vibrations.
					The pilot considered himself unable to return to England and intended to go to Sweden; another Mustang joined
					as an escort to protect against enemy fighters. The flight to Sweden went without major problems and on
					arrival successfully crash landed in a field at Lomma. It is also not entirely clear why the pilot crash landed;
					the tail wheel was extended and it is likely that the main landing gear could not be extended. The escorting
					Mustang landed normally in the same field, possibly with the intention of picking up the pilot and flying him
					to England. However, this did not happen and both pilots were interned in Korsnäs until they were sent back to

					the tight formation of bombers became scattered. After the target, the remaining bombers turned
					north towards the North Sea into a tremendous headwind which slowed the planes down to a ground
					speed of ninety miles per hour. They were immediately pounced on by German fighters which made ten

					Crossbow mission to a German V-1 flying bomb launch site at Gorenflos, east of Abbeville, France
					20Apr44. Flak was moderate but accurate. Battle damaged on a mission to the Luftwaffe airfield at
					Le Bourget, Paris 14Jun44 (1EVD:10RMC). As the formation approached the target on the bomb run,
					heavy and accurate flak was encountered. The aircraft was the lead plane in the squadron. One German
					fighter made a pass at the plane; the attack was over as fast as it started. A little while later
					other crews spotted a single parachute slowly going down. This was puzzling since they had not seen
					any planes go down. More puzzling was the fact that the formation was still heading deeper into
					enemy territory even though they had dropped their bombs. They were going farther and farther away
					from home and nobody could understand why the lead plane was not trying to get them out of France as
					fast as possible. Finally, the formation did turn around and head out. The German fighter had hit
					the flare box that set off an extreme amount of smoke. The pilot assumed the plane was on fire and
					sounded the bailout alarm for the crew to abandon. The fighter had disabled the internal
					communication system so that the crew never heard the order to jump. The co-pilot and engineer
					crawled to the nose of the plane to jump out the escape hatch there. It was frozen shut, so they
					headed for the bomb bay doors. The smoke had cleared by this time and the co-pilot discovered that
					the fire had only been from the flare box. He climbed into the pilot seat and flew the plane safely
					back to Glatton. Two things had happened in the meantime: the lead pilot had jumped out the bomb bay
					doors not knowing that the crew was still in the plane, thus explaining the single parachute; the
					entire group had been following the lead plane, which apparently was flying without a pilot, as they
					drifted further and further away from home. The pilot somehow travelled to Spain without being
					captured and returned to England; he was so embarrassed about abandoning his plane and crew that he
					volunteered for a second tour of duty over Europe. Condemned 15Jun44. Salvaged by 2nd Strategic Air
					Depot, Abbots Ripton 15Jun44.

					Germany 11May44. Restricted visibility made it difficult to sight the primary target. The AFCE in
					both lead aircraft were disabled by flak and runs were made visually by PDI. The Group was unable to
					locate the primary target until immediately over it. A second bomb run was attempted, but the target
					still could not be seen. The Group turned off and bombed the marshalling yards at Volkingen, Germany
					as a target of opportunity. A few enemy fighters were seen but none attacked the formation; moderate
					and extremely accurate flak was encountered over the target area. Battle damaged on a mission to the
					Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau AG aircraft factory at Krzesiny, Poznan, Poland 29May44. Fighter opposition
					was moderate but ineffective; moderate and accurate flak was encountered to and from the target. The

					an aero engine factory at Meinau, Strasbourg, France 27May44. While high over England the oxygen
					supply lines to the right waist and ball turret fractured. The waist gunner could be plugged in to
					the other side of the fuselage and also make use of the emergency oxygen bottles, but these could
					not be taken to the ball turret. The situation was assessed and it was established there would be
					insufficient emergency oxygen to supply the two men all the way to the target and back. The pilot
					found that he had no option but to abort the mission and informed the crew. The ball turret gunner
					then suggested that he should bail out as this would ensure sufficient oxygen for the right waist
					gunner and any likely emergencies. After some discussion the pilot was persuaded to give permission.
					Two other gunners held open the fuselage door while the gunner jumped out. A safe landing was made
					and he returned to base while his comrades flew on to the target. Accident after return from a
					mission to the BMW Flugmotorenbau aero engine factory at Allach, Munich, Germany 11Jul44 (1KIS). The
					crew had left the parked bomber at Thorpe Abbotts; the ball turret gunner disengaged the gear train
					on the ball turret and exited the plane to check and remove his twin 0.50 calibre Browning machine
					guns. He had not taken action to prevent ammunition from feeding into the guns; both guns were
					charged three or four times, feeding live rounds into the chambers, before disassembly was started.
					The recoil from both 0.50s going off started the ball turret revolving around in a circle. The
					bullets were hitting other planes and vehicles parked all around. The ball turret gunner panicked
					and ran away from the plane. The ball turret rotated around and was tracking towards him. Everybody
					started yelling to him to hit the ground but he didn't. The machine guns caught the ball turret
					gunner as he ran and killed him. Aircraft 42-31256 was struck in a wing by an incendiary bullet,
					caught fire and destroyed; 42-39867 and 42-102416 were damaged. This plane had damage to no.2 engine,
					no.2 and no.3 propellers, the tail wheel and left main landing gear. Failed to return from a mission
					to the I.G. Farben Leunawerke synthetic oil refinery at Leuna, Merseburg, Germany 29Jul44
					(1MIA:8POW). The formation was led on a faulty course which went over Leipzig and flew on a
					southerly course towards Merseburg; it was hit in a barrage of extremely heavy flak. In the next few
					minutes, the low squadron of the 100th BG was hit hard, losing five of six planes. The lead aircraft
					was hit by flak before the target and jettisoned the bombs. This caused the formation to break up;
					the entire low squadron of the 100th BG 'A' Group failed to return. The aircraft was observed to
					have one engine smoking as it went over the target. It had been struck by flak which also knocked
					out the oxygen in the nose of the aircraft forcing the bombardier and navigator to retreat to the
					radio room; the waist gunner was severely wounded and unconscious. It dropped back and took over the
					lead of the second element of the low squadron and gradually lagged further and further behind.
					Friendly fighters were all around and when last seen the bomber was under control and appeared to be
					in good condition. It was later seen over Wesermünde by a flight of P-38 Lightnings from 479th
					Fighter Group. A Me 262 jet fighter was attacking the bomber but was driven off by the P-38s. The
					bomber was escorted until it reached the Frisian Islands where the P-38's were forced to return to
					England because of fuel exhaustion. When last seen all engines were operating and the bomber was
					headed for home at 10,000ft. Still losing altitude, the crew spotted water and decided to ditch the
					aircraft in the North Sea north of Ameland, Netherlands. Eight crew members survived the ditching;
					the wounded waist gunner went down with the B-17. The survivors spent four days at sea. On the
					second day, a sailing vessel appeared on the horizon and seemingly heading in their direction. As it
					became closer, they fired flares and pistols into the air in hopes of attraction their attention.
					The ship became close enough that they could see a flag painted on the hull and took it to be Danish.
					What seemed like eternity, the ship proceeded on its way, choosing to ignore the survivors and left
					them floundering in frustration. Two dinghies had been tied together to prevent them being separated.
					During the four days at sea the survivors could hear aircraft flying over but the overcast prevented
					visual contact. Late afternoon on the fourth day at sea, land was sighted. Separating the two
					dinghies, they raced, paddling to shore, firing flares into the air only to be met by German
					soldiers who took them prisoners. They had landed on Ameland, one of the West Frisian Islands, north
					Netherlands. SHE-HASTA [She Has to Get Back] - artwork of a woman wearing a windswept long skirt.

					primary target was covered with clouds so the formation headed north for the Hydrierwerke Pölitz AG
					synthetic oil plant at Pölitz which was also obscured by cloud cover. The formation found a target
					of opportunity, the industrial area of Stettin, Prussia. Friendly fighter support was good, but in

					over Berlin. Battle damaged on a mission to a Luftwaffe airfield at Saint-Dizier, France 9May44.
					Moderate and accurate flak was encountered at Saint-Dizier; there was no enemy fighter opposition.
					Major battle damage during a mission to a Luftwaffe aircraft repair depot at Villacoublay, Paris,
					France 20May44. No enemy fighter opposition was encountered; flak was moderate but accurate. Battle
					damaged on a tactical mission to coastal defences at Houlgate, France 5Jun44. An engine supercharger
					failed during assembly over England and then the engine over the water. Since the crew had never
					aborted a mission they continued. Unable to keep up with the formation, an alternative target was
					selected; believed to have been an airfield, in retrospect the bombardier believed it was a missile
					launching site. There was intensive flak over the target disabling two more engines. With one
					remaining engine the pilot managed to limp back to RAF Tangmere, Chichester, West Sussex on the
					south coast of England and made a dead-stick landing when the last engine failed at the edge of the
					airfield. 2nd Strategic Air Depot, Abbots Ripton (Station 547), Huntingdonshire. It took M/Sgt
					Elliott and his crew about ten days to change the engines and make other necessary repairs. When the
					pilot and his crew went to fly the plane back to Bassingbourn they were stunned, it looked like new!

					marshalling yards at Saarbrücken, Germany 11May44. Restricted visibility made it difficult to sight
					the primary target. The AFCE in both lead aircraft were disabled by flak and runs were made visually
					by PDI. The Group was unable to locate the primary target until immediately over it. A second bomb
					run was made but did not make a good run because of anti-aircraft fire. A few enemy fighters were
					seen but none attacked the formation; moderate and extremely accurate flak was encountered over the
					target area. Failed to return from a mission to the Modis thermal electric power station, Leipzig,
					Germany 28May44 (7KIA:3POW). There was moderate but very accurate flak in the Leipzig area. The
					plane received a direct flak hit close to the no.4 engine; the right wing immediately caught fire.
					The aircraft slid under the formation, the right wing came off, it rolled over on its back and went
					down. The tail came off at the rear entrance door; some parachutes were reported. Crashed near

					took very heavy flak. Battle damaged on a mission to the Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau AG aircraft factory
					at Cottbus, Germany 11Apr44. Heavy and accurate flak was encountered most of the way in. The target
					area was found to be covered in low cloud preventing dropping bombs on the primary. The bomb bay
					doors were closed and the formation proceeded to the secondary target, a factory near Gülzow,
					Germany. The Group could not sight because of broken cloud, and so retained their bombs until able
					to attack a target of opportunity. The return trip was made without incident until the Danish coast
					was reached; at that point, heavy and accurate flak was encountered. Major battle damage on a
					mission to targets in the city of Berlin, Germany 29Apr44. Flak was intense and accurate at the
					target. After leaving target a continuous succession of bursts were encountered ranging from
					moderate to intense. Battle damaged during a mission to railway marshalling yards at Troyes, France
					1May44. Moderate and accurate flak was encountered over the coast on the way home; there was no
					enemy fighter opposition. Major battle damage on a mission to Friedrichstraße railway station,
					Berlin, Germany 7May44 (2WIA:8RMC). No enemy fighters were seen and friendly support was
					satisfactory; accurate flak was encountered at Dümmer See, Germany, but was inaccurate over Berlin.
					Battle damaged on a mission to the Wintershall AG synthetic oil refinery at Lützkendorf, six miles
					west of Merseburg, Germany 12May44. Because of heavy smoke over the target, the railway marshalling
					yards two miles west were bombed. No enemy fighter opposition was encountered; flak was moderate but
					accurate. Battle damaged on a mission to military installations in Berlin, Germany 24May44. The
					formation was attacked by a force of enemy fighters going into and on return from the target. Flak
					was intense and accurate over the target. Battle damaged on a mission to the Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau
					AG aircraft factory at Krzesiny, Poznan, Poland 29May44. Only weak resistance was encountered from
					the German fighter force; there was meagre and inaccurate flak over the target. Battle damaged on a
					mission to the Junkers Flugzeug-und Motorenwerke aero engine factory at Dessau, Germany 30May44
					(1WIA:8RMC). Enemy opposition, both from flak and fighters, was greater than it had been for some
					time. The flak was heavy and accurate and the fighters came right into the attack formation; radio
					operator was wounded. Battle damaged during a mission to a synthetic oil refinery in Hamburg,
					Germany 20Jun44. Flak over the target was intense and accurate. The aircraft had fifteen to twenty
					flak holes and damage. Number one engine induction system was hit, number two engine cowling was hit,
					and number four superchargers were disabled. The wings and stabilizer were hit several times and the
					radio antenna was knocked off. The fuselage from the waist back had some large holes; unexploded
					shells and large pieces of flak were lying around the interior. Battle damaged by flak on a Crossbow
					mission to a German V-1 flying bomb launch site at Aire-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France 6Jul44.
					The squadron made three 360 degree turns in the target area, finally bombing a last resort target
					northeast of Estrée-Blanche. Failed to return from a tactical mission to a railway bridge over the

					extremely accurate flak over the target. Just prior to bomb release the plane took a direct flak hit
					in the cockpit and fire broke out as oxygen bottles exploded and hydraulic fluid fed the blaze. The
					pilot held the plane steady, staying with the formation to bomb, then turned sharply upwards and
					away before peeling off to the left. In the next four minutes the plane dived several times,
					levelling off between each dive. The pilot circled over Incarville to give the crew time to bail out
					from the aircraft but didn't escape the plane which went into a steep dive close to the ground
					before crashing into a house at the junction of Rue d'Epreville and Rue des Près, Épreville,

					(9RMC). The primary and secondary target, an electrolytic hydrogen-peroxide facility at Peenemünde,
					Prussia, were under heavy cloud coverage so the bomb run was made on a last resort target, the naval
					and shipbuilding areas of Stettin, Prussia. Meagre, inaccurate flak en route with moderate to heavy
					and accurate flak over the target; enemy fighters were observed but did not attack this Group. Flak
					damaged no.2 and no.3 engines. When a third engine failed, the plane ditched in the North Sea about
					eight miles off the English coast; the pilot was heard telling control that he had to ditch with
					fuel exhaustion. The pilot of another 306th Bomb Group plane [42-97180] heard the transmission,
					dropped down and circled the plane on the water, reporting its position. Sea was calm with slight
					wind and the plane stayed afloat almost an hour. The left dinghy failed to inflate or else floated
					under the plane. In the right dinghy were five men, with three hanging to the side, and another in a
					Mae West swimming. Two RAF P-51 Mustangs appeared soon after ditching and fired flares; then two
					Vickers Wellingtons appeared and circled the position. The other 306BG bomber departed when a rescue
					cutter was a few hundred yards from the dinghy and reported that it had the dinghy in sight.

					Damaged by flak just before reaching the Initial Point, north of Bayreuth, the no.2 engine was
					disabled. The pilot aborted the mission and returned safely to Bassingbourn. Battle damaged on a
					tactical mission in support of Operation Overlord to a Luftwaffe air depot at Chartres, France
					1Aug44 (1WIA). The plane was flying on the right wing of 42-97879 which was shot down by flak. This
					bomber had about sixty holes in the middle of the fuselage when it landed back at Bassingbourn. The
					navigator was wounded. Failed to return from a mission to the I.G. Farben chemical works at Oppau,
					Ludwigshafen, Germany 5Sep44 (1KIA:1POW:7EVD). The plane was the last to takeoff. In heavy propeller
					wash it drifted to the right and, just before becoming airborne, hit a landing light and blew a tire.
					Over France the weather steadily worsened. Near Metz, France, the Group ran into heavy flak. No.3
					engine was struck by flak and failed caused by an oil leak; it was overheating and the propeller was
					feathered. The flak had also disabled no.4 engine and the propeller was feathered to eliminate the
					possibility of fire. Just before the I.P. the lead aircraft advised the Group they were to climb an
					extra 3,000ft to 24,000ft in an attempt to get on top of the still-worsening weather. With only two
					engines, the plane was unable to keep up or climb and couldn't even stay under the low squadron. The
					Group leader advised the pilot to turn back, find a hole, and see if he could get far enough to find
					a landing field in liberated France. A third engine was not producing power when German Bf 109
					fighters attacked out of the clouds from behind, killing the tail gunner, destroying part of the
					rudder and elevator, and cutting off communication with the rear of the aircraft. After a couple
					more hits on the wing near the no.3 engine, the plane was down to 6,000ft and there was still no
					sign of any opening in the ground cover. The pilot rang the bailout bell and told the crew to go.
					The plane crashed on a flat field, skidded across a creek, broke up and destroyed by fire in a small
					wood near Bazailles, east of Pierrepont, about 10km southeast of Longuyon, France. {59 missions}.

					return from the target the Group was attacked by enemy fighters before reaching the Danish coast.
					After the plane had dropped its bombs on the target, six enemy fighters attacked it from the rear;
					at the same time, a force on enemy fighters started to attack from the nose. A 20mm cannon shell
					exploded in the waist section, peppering the right waist gunner with shrapnel in both legs. Although
					wounded, he remained at his guns while the navigator applied first aid. Two engines on the right
					side of the plane were hit by the 20mm shells and a third engine, on the other wing, started to
					throw oil and sputter; it was starting to fail. The pilot dropped out of formation and flew back
					hedge-hopping over Germany. While only about forty feet above the ground, the bomber flew over a
					German army camp. The Germans used everything that they could fire against the plane. The bomber's
					gunners were shooting at every military installation in sight - it was a gunner's holiday. While out
					over the North Sea, fifteen miles from England, the third engine failed and the crew started to toss
					everything that was not screwed down out of the windows in order to retain altitude. Unable to make
					it back to Deopham Green, the pilot crash landed on Nova Scotia farm at Caister-on-Sea, Great

					mission to bomb enemy troop positions near Saint-Lô, France 24Jul44. Somewhere over the English
					Channel, less than a half hour from the target and without warning, an oil line in the no.1 engine
					broke. The first indication something was wrong was when the protective cowling around the leading
					edge of the engine began to come apart. The co-pilot tried to feather the propeller to reduce drag
					and prevent it from windmilling but the loss of oil prevented it. The propeller began to spin out of
					control; within minutes, it melted off its shaft. The propeller and the rest of the cowling tumbled
					into the sea below but the plane returned to a safe landing at Deenethorpe. 2nd Strategic Air Depot,

					after bomb release, no.3 and no.4 engines were knocked out by flak which also damaged the aircraft
					controls and instruments. The aircraft went into a dive from which the pilots managed to recover at
					a low altitude. The crew started to jettison guns, ammunition and other removable equipment in an
					effort to maintain height and flying speed. The plane proceeded in a westerly direction on its
					single working engine for about another hour before the pilot gave orders to abandon the aircraft.
					The enlisted crew gathered at the rear of the aircraft and all except the togglier successfully
					bailed out. He remained aboard for another fifteen minutes during which time he, the co-pilot and
					navigator worked to lighten the aircraft further by throwing out anything that was loose. The pilot

					damaged during a mission to the Dornier Flugzeugwerke factory at Oberpfaffenhofen, Munich, Germany
					24Apr44 (2KIA:4WIA:4RMC). Strong enemy fighter opposition was encountered as soon as the formation
					entered Germany. Flak was moderate to intense and accurate inbound over the coast; intense and
					accurate over and after the target. Just before the bomber reached the target, a head-on enemy
					fighter attack killed the navigator, and seriously wounded the bombardier. At the same time the
					oxygen system was shot out, and a few seconds later an explosive shell struck the pilot on the sole
					of his boot; his foot and leg were paralyzed. Later on the return to base, a direct flak burst had
					hit the waist killing one waist gunner, and seriously wounded the ball turret gunner. While

					Air Depot, Abbots Ripton (Station 547), Huntingdonshire 17Aug44. Regained by Group 3Sep44. Accident
					landing at Membury (Station 466), Berkshire 30Nov44. The landing accident occurred following a
					cross-country flight from Thurleigh, Bedfordshire. Although the aircraft's brakes were functioning
					properly, the runway was slippery and the tyres would not hold. According to those who witnessed the
					accident the pilot should have touched down on to the runway sooner than he did. However the pilot
					felt that he had landed well within the first third of the runway and that the accident was entirely
					due to the slippery conditions. Once the B-17 started to skid, the pilot tried desperately to gain
					control by cutting numbers two and three engines and continually applying and releasing the brakes.
					He soon realised that he wasn't going to stop in time and tried to ground-loop the aircraft, but was
					unable to control its direction. The plane shot off the end of the runway at a speed of about 40 mph.
					The right wheel fell in to a hole causing the right wing to drop and the engines to dig in. It then
					skidded over a small embankment and across a road before coming to a halt. The only member of the
					crew to receive injuries was the navigator. The wrecked B-17 remained at the end of Membury's runway
					for over a week before a team from the 2nd Strategic Air Depot, Abbots Ripton arrived to remove it.
					The plane had come to a stop right at the boundary of the aerodrome and at a point directly in line
					with the runway. Fortunately, tests of dual glider takeoff procedures were being conducted on a
					different runway. Landing aircraft were ending their rolls and turning off to the perimeter track
					just a short distance away. There was a possibility that another plane could overrun. That became
					reality two or three days later. The C-47 that crashed into the B-17 was one of many that were
					arriving with loads of wounded troops, most of them from Patton's army. This second damaging of the
					B-17 changed the nature of the salvage task. They had been working to carefully disassemble the
					plane so that the large components could be used for replacement parts intact. Now they began the
					removal of smaller pieces of equipment, and soon a pair of 6x6 trucks arrived from 2nd SAD to pick
					them up. Condemned salvage 3Dec44.

					during a mission to the BMW Flugmotorenbau aero engine factory at Allach, Munich, Germany 13Jul44.
					Moderate, accurate flak was encountered at Ludwigshafen and Mannheim with intense flak at the target,
					damaging the nose. Battle damaged on a mission to the I.G. Farben Leunawerke synthetic oil refinery
					at Leuna, Merseburg, Germany 28Jul44 (9RMC). Diverted to an alternate target, the Taucha aero engine
					factory at Leipzig, Germany. Meagre flak was encountered at Koblenz and Kassel with accurate heavy
					flak at the target, causing a large hole in the left wing near no.2 fuel tank and one very near no.4
					engine oil cooler; also two holes in a horizontal stabilizer. Battle damaged on a mission to the
					I.G. Farben Leunawerke synthetic oil refinery at Leuna, Merseburg, Germany 29Jul44 (9RMC). The
					bombers encountered heavy flak over the target which disrupted the formation. One piece of shrapnel
					went through the Plexiglas nose and hit bombardier on the knee but wasn't hurt. Shrapnel made a hole
					in the no.3 fuel tank which sealed itself and touched a wing spar but no significant damage.
					Shrapnel went through the tail gunner's position but missed him and went out through the canvas gun
					covers. Another piece just missed the tail wheel. Landing gear drag strut damaged during landing by
					a new crew after a practice mission at Bassingbourn 30Jul44. Battle damaged on a mission to an
					aircraft factory at Brandenburg, Germany 6Aug44. Moderate to intense barrage and tracking flak was
					encountered over the target. The Group leader took the formation too close to Berlin where the flak
					was heavy and intense. A flak shell struck the fuselage near the main entrance causing a big hole.
					The fuse of a shell went through and hit the tail wheel assembly. More shrapnel went through the
					right wing and struck no.4 fuel tank. Battle damaged during a mission to Munich, Germany 9Aug44. Bad
					weather turned the Group back over Germany and picked a target of opportunity, military
					installations at Eisenborn, Belgium. Flak caused a leak in a 'Tokyo' fuel tank, shot up an engine
					sump and the radio compass. Later found close to fifty holes in the plane. Battle damaged during a
					mission to industrial, oil and rail installations in Cologne, Germany 15Oct44. En route to the
					target, flak was meagre and inaccurate. From the I.P. to the target, flak was continuous, increasing
					in intensity and accuracy. Some meagre, inaccurate flak was experienced on the route back.
					{70 missions}. Battle damaged on a mission to a railway viaduct at Altenbeken, Germany 26Nov44
					(9RMC). About half an hour before the target, the formation was attacked by German fighters. The
					bomber took a number of 20mm cannon shell hits that damaged no.2 engine, caught the left wing on
					fire, shredded the tail surfaces, cut off oxygen to the rear of the plane, knocked out much of the
					instrument panel, jammed the ball turret and tail guns, and sprung the bomb bay doors open. In spite
					of all this, the pilot held the plane in formation as it flew on to the target with the rear crewmen
					relying on 'walk-around' oxygen tanks. As it went over the target, the togglier found that the bomb
					shackles were jammed and the bombs would not drop. By tugging and kicking at the shackles, he was
					able to jettison the bombs on the way back to England. For three hours the crew fought the fire, but
					the bomber continued to burn, eventually stopping the no.2 engine, causing the aircraft to lose
					altitude. Still, the plane was flying and the fires did not seem to be spreading. The pilot followed
					at a safe distance behind the 323rd Squadron formation so as not to take out any other planes should
					it blow up. Over the North Sea it picked up an escort from a flight of P-47 Thunderbolts. When the
					plane reached England, the pilot headed for the first airfield he could find, barely making it to
					the 56th Fighter Group base at Halesworth (Station 365), fifteen miles southwest of Lowestoft,
					Suffolk. The windshield was iced over and a wing flap was jammed, causing the plane to swerve off
					the runway and pile into two trucks and a concrete mixer. The bomber became a flaming inferno. The
					crew scrambled out safely. In a few minutes, only the tips of the wings were left. Condemned salvage
					28Nov44. Salvaged by 2nd Strategic Air Depot, Abbots Ripton. ROUND TRIP TOPSY. Named by the pilot

					Accident departing on a mission to the Luftwaffe airfield at Eschwege, southeast of Kassel, Germany
					19Apr44. A fire started in the back of the instrument panel caused by a short circuit in the
					rheostat of the fluorescent lighting on the panel. The pilot aborted the mission and returned safely
					to Bassingbourn. Failed to return from a mission to the Messerschmitt experimental airfield at
					Lechfeld, Augsburg, Germany 19Jul44 (9INT). Seven minutes before the release on the bomb run, B-17G
					42-31542 had been caught by the propeller wash of a preceding aircraft and was in a mid-air
					collision with this plane. Turbulence threw #542 suddenly to the left and struck #075 on the right
					wing, the propellers of #075 slicing into the fuselage of #542 by the main hatch. #075 went into a
					spin which the pilot managed to recover after five turns and keep his plane under control while his
					crew watched helplessly as #542 plunged earthwards, severed in two. Badly damaged, #075 was pulled
					out of formation and the pilot radioed that he would try to make the safety of neutral Switzerland.
					Engine number 4 had failed, engine number 3 was running at half power and had a bent propeller, the
					leading edge of the right wing was completely missing and a large piece of the aileron was missing.
					The pilot jettisoned the bombs as the crew threw out anything they could; attempts to jettison the
					ball turret failed. The crippled plane reached safety over Obersaxen, Switzerland but, unable to fly
					over the Alps, there was no chance of a safe landing. The crew abandoned the plane before it plunged
					into a rocky mount and was totally destroyed on the southeast slope of the Titschalrücken. The crew
					were interned by the Swiss. Salvaged by the Swiss. {45 missions}. CHAMPAGNE GIRL / FANCY PANTS.

					the airplane was not on fire, try to keep the airplane flying. As the pilot headed towards home,
					they encountered an Allied fighter plane and the pilot motioned to the bomber pilot to follow him to
					his base. They followed him for over an hour and during that time they threw everything out of the
					plane in order to lighten the load and save fuel. When the crew tried to jettison the ball turret,
					the bolts bent and the turret was just hanging down from the plane. Coming in for a landing with

					bomb and so the Group executed a large 360° turn. Accurate flak was encountered on the first run.
					Large hole through right wing inner panel aft no.3 engine nacelle caused by unexploded 88mm flak
					shell; hole in left side of vertical stabilizer. Battle damaged on a Crossbow mission to a German
					V-1 flying bomb launch site at Bois Coquerel, Marbeuf, Normandy, France 20Apr44. Enemy aircraft were
					not encountered; flak was moderate and accurate from Dieppe, over the target and out over Cherbourg.
					Battle damaged on a mission to Friedrichstraße railway station, Berlin, Germany 7May44. No enemy
					fighters were seen and friendly support was satisfactory; accurate flak was encountered at Vechta,
					Germany, but was inaccurate over Berlin. Battle damaged during a mission to the Hydrierwerke
					Pölitz AG synthetic oil plant at Pölitz, Prussia 13May44. The primary and secondary target, an
					electrolytic hydrogen-peroxide facility at Peenemünde, Prussia, were under heavy cloud coverage so
					the bomb run was made on a last resort target, the naval and shipbuilding areas of Stettin, Prussia.
					Meagre, inaccurate flak en route with moderate to heavy flak over the target; the combat wing came
					under vicious attack from German fighters but it was quickly broken up by the P-51 Mustang escorts.
					Battle damaged during a mission to railway marshalling yards at Blainville, France 23May44. Meagre
					and inaccurate flak was encountered over the target; there was no enemy fighter opposition. Battle
					damaged during a mission to Friedrichstraße railway station, Berlin, Germany 24May44. There was no
					fighter opposition; flak was intense and accurate. Battle damaged on a mission to railway
					marshalling yards at Ludwigshafen, Germany 27May44. A large force of enemy fighters was active in
					the area, but none attacked the Group; at the target, flak was moderate to intense and accurate.
					Battle damaged on a mission to the Junkers Flugzeug-und Motorenwerke aero engine factory at Dessau,
					Germany 28May44. A large enemy fighter force was encountered before the I.P. and on to the rally
					point after the target. Flak over the target was meagre and inaccurate. Failed to return from a
					mission to the Bayerische Motoren Werke aero engine works at Munich, Germany 31Jul44 (9INT). En
					route to the target, engine number 2 began to lose oil. The pilot decided to fly over the target
					first and drop the bombs afterwards instead of dropping the bombs and flying around the target. The
					number 2 propeller could not be brought into feathering position; after all the oil was lost, it
					spun freely and caused severe vibrations. Over the target the plane came under heavy anti-aircraft
					fire and engine number 3 was hit. The crew jettisoned the bombs and turned away. At that moment two
					rockets passed by, which would inevitably have hit the plane if it had not turned away. When engine
					number 3 failed, the propeller also could not be brought to feather and the vibrations increased
					accordingly. There was a risk that engines number 1 and number 4 would overheat and the pilot had to
					reduce power. The plane quickly lost altitude and the crew knew they couldn't get back to England so
					set course for Switzerland. On landing it was discovered that one of the main landing gear tires was
					shot and the tail wheel had already burst during takeoff; it was difficult to keep the plane from
					ground looping. Force landed Dübendorf, Zürich, Switzerland. Recaptured by US Government. Assigned
					to GLUE (United States Air Forces in Europe) Sep45. Flown to UK 1Sep45. Base Air Depot No.1,

					the strong wind took the flyers out to sea away from land and two fishing boats set out to help. The
					search was difficult because of heavy waves and a German Do 24 seaplane searched the area and guided
					in several cases the fishing boats towards what was believed to be flyers, but in each case it
					turned out to be floating wood. The rescue launch picked the pilot up from the sea and sailed to
					Gedser. The rest of the crew did not survive and most of their bodies were found many days later.

					in the cockpit and seriously damaged the controls. The bombardier jettisoned the bombs but one
					remained hanging and it was unable to be released. Its locking lever rotated in the swirl of the

					Failed to return from a mission to the BMW Flugmotorenbau aero engine factory at Allach, Munich,
					Germany 13Jul44 (10INT). Moderate, accurate flak was encountered at Ludwigshafen and Mannheim with
					intense flak at the target. Near Augsburg, the Initial Point, the engines began detonating and the
					plane was unable to keep speed up with the others in formation. The pilot dropped some of the bombs
					and then proceeded to drop all of them as the crew started throwing all available weighty things out
					of the waist; guns, ammunition, anything that could be thrown out, was. Then, with the problem of
					not being able to maintain speed or altitude, the pilot made a 180 degree turn, heading westward
					towards England. Immediately, the plane was struck by flak, a direct hit behind no.3 engine and lost
					all fuel from no.3 tank. With insufficient fuel to reach England the pilot turned off towards
					Switzerland. The crew was instructed to bail out but not one of them did. Two Swiss Air Force
					fighters indicated to follow them. The engineer cranked out the landing gear because the hydraulics
					had failed. Force landed at a Swiss Air Force fighter airfield at Payerne, Switzerland. Recaptured
					by US Government. Assigned to GLUE (United States Air Forces in Europe) Sep45. Repaired and the last

					leaving the target, no.2 engine was struck by a cannon shell from an enemy fighter. The engine
					caught fire and parts of the cowling came off as the aircraft started a banking dive into cloud. A
					20mm cannon shell struck the navigator who immediately lost consciousness. The oxygen system by the

					begun to cross the enemy coast en route to the target when no.2 engine started to fall apart. The
					navigator called to pilot and said that the top cylinder was flying out. The pilot was unable to
					feather the propeller and the engine continued to disintegrate. The plane dropped out of formation
					and headed back to base. The no.2 engine caught fire and burned fiercely and the windmilling
					propeller caused the plane to vibrate. After a while the fire went out and the vibration stopped.
					The bombs had been jettisoned but the enlisted men didn't know that the plane had been losing
					altitude and were still on oxygen approximately five or ten seconds before the plane hit the water.
					The bomber ditched in the North Sea sixty miles off Haarlem, Netherlands. The tail gunner was
					knocked out but regained consciousness sometime later, at which time he was floating in the water
					inside the plane. The plane was about half submerged and he exited through a hole in the side. He
					had hardly cleared the plane when it sank. The ball turret gunner had been thrown clear of the plane
					in the crash. The two gunners were the only survivors, rescued by Air-Sea Rescue. MAIRZY DOATS.

					enemy fighters were seen. Battle damaged on a mission to railway marshalling yards at Saarbrücken,
					Germany 11May44 (4WIA:6RMC). Restricted visibility made it difficult to sight the primary target.
					The AFCE in both lead aircraft were disabled by flak and runs were made visually by PDI. The Group
					was unable to locate the primary target until immediately over it. A second bomb run was made but
					did not make a good run because of anti-aircraft fire. A few enemy fighters were seen but none
					attacked the formation; moderate and extremely accurate flak was encountered over the target area.
					Flak disabled the navigator's oxygen and one outboard engine and blew off one of the bomb bay doors
					on the second bomb run. The pilot left the formation, struggling to maintain altitude. At 11,000
					feet anti-aircraft guns opened up and he dove his bomber toward the ground. He ordered the crew to
					move forward of the bomb bay to maintain aircraft balance and to jettison all excess equipment.
					Flying at tree top level, the crew experienced German 88mm gunfire from a ground pill box that
					injured four crewmen. The plane passed through German coastal defences and flew very low across the
					North Sea to the English coast. The pilot located a Royal Air Force training airfield on the Thames
					Estuary at RAF Rochford, Southend-on-Sea, Essex. Making a hot, two-engine landing, the two pilots
					avoided a concrete ammunition building, crashed through a fence, lost the right landing gear and
					slid into a ditch that stopped the plane. {8 missions}. Condemned 23May44. Condemned salvage 5Jul44.

					(1KIA:9POW). The mission was a disastrous day for the 483rd Bomb Group; the Group lost fourteen of
					its twenty-six aircraft. The 483d Bomb Group had become separated from the other groups largely as a
					result of bad weather and arrived late and alone at the Initial Point at Kempten. It was immediately
					attacked from the rear by a large force of enemy fighters. The fighter escort arrived eight minutes
					after the initial attack and was very effective from then on, despite the fact that they were
					heavily outnumbered. The 332nd Fighter Group had waited longer than orders required, and when the
					bombers finally arrived the Tuskegee Airmen escorted them against a superior force. The enemy
					aircraft attack lasted twenty minutes. Attacked by enemy fighters, the crew bailed out before the
					plane crashed near Kempten, Germany.

					The AFCE in both lead aircraft were disabled by flak and runs were made visually by PDI. The Group
					was unable to locate the primary target until immediately over it. A second bomb run was made but
					did not make a good run because of anti-aircraft fire. A few enemy fighters were seen but none
					attacked the formation; moderate and extremely accurate flak was encountered over the target area.
					The pilot's and co-pilot's control cables were damaged, the no.2 engine's hydraulic line was
					shattered and the IFF radio equipment smashed. Radio Operator was wounded when shrapnel from a flak
					burst penetrated the radio room. 2nd Strategic Air Depot, Abbots Ripton (Station 547),

					AG synthetic oil refinery at Schwarzheide, Ruhland, Germany 12Sep44 (9POW). The combat wings were
					not on time causing several to make detours to avoid collisions and the Berlin area flak defences.
					During this manoeuvre enemy fighters took advantage and attacked the formations. The primary target
					could not be identified so the formation turned to the Vereinigte Aluminium-Werke AG works at Lauta,

					Group took off in terrible weather and flew to the target through squalls and even worse. The
					airfield at Pleurtuit was the base for 2 Staffel of Nahaufklärungsgruppe 13, a German fighter
					interceptor unit equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109G aircraft. This unit would regularly intercept
					and attack bombers on their return flights from targets in Germany; consequently it was necessary to
					disrupt operations from this base. After the bomb run the bombers turned away and headed north
					towards the Channel Islands to follow the route back to England. This plane had been hit by flak
					over the target and was last seen about ten and a half miles south of Guernsey with one of its
					engines on fire, either no.3 or no.4 engine. The pilot tried several steep dives and climbs to
					extinguish the flames, which he hoped would blow out the fire, but these were unsuccessful. The
					aircraft was last seen in a dive as it entered the undercast. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out;
					a number of parachutes were reported by other aircraft in the formation. The B-17 had been flying at
					21,000ft, probably descending, when its crew bailed out. At this height, the heavy storm clouds

					fighter opposition was encountered from Stuttgart until after the target; flak was meagre but
					accurate inbound over the coast and moderate to intense over the target. The plane was hit by flak
					in the target area and was badly damaged; it was last seen heading towards Switzerland. The pilot
					could not hold the plane in formation and it was soon hit in a nose attack by enemy fighters. The
					radio operator had been killed in the radio room by 20mm gunfire and the bomb bay area was on fire.
					The surviving crew members attempted to contact the airmen in the nose and, when receiving no reply,
					assumed that these men had been killed. At this time the three surviving crewmen, the waist and tail
					gunners, jumped from the tail hatch. The ball turret gunner had spilled his parachute in the waist
					area and was in the process of buckling on the spare parachute. At this time the plane banked sharp
					left and went into a tight spiral dive. It was assumed that the gunner was thrown against the inside
					wall of the bomber, pinned there by centrifugal force and unable to reach the escape hatch. The
					bomber crashed near Großseeham, close to the town of Irschenberg, 46km southeast of Munich, Germany.

					Cologne, Germany 17Oct44. Flak was moderate and accurate over the target and at Koblenz. Battle
					damaged on a tactical mission to targets around Thionville, France 5Nov44. Cloud cover prevented
					visual bombing to avoid dropping on allied troops so the Group moved on to strategic secondary
					targets, railway marshalling yards and the I.G. Farben chemical works at Oppau, Ludwigshafen,
					Germany. Flak over the battle lines and at the target was intense and accurate damaging a 'Tokyo'
					fuel tank. Battle damaged on a mission to the Rhenania-Ossag Mineralölwerke oil refinery at Harburg,
					Hamburg, Germany 31Dec44. Flak was encountered at several locations en route and on the return home;
					flak around Hamburg was intense and accurate. Prior to the target, fighter attacks created havoc for
					five minutes or more as the tight formation of bombers became scattered. After the target, the
					remaining bombers turned north towards the North Sea into a tremendous headwind which slowed the
					planes down to a ground speed of ninety miles per hour. They were immediately pounced on by German
					fighters which made ten passes at the formation. Battle damaged on a tactical mission to a railway
					bridge across the River Rhine at Breisach, between Freiburg, Germany and Colmar, France 20Jan45. A
					prominent wind shift caused the formation to drift ten miles south of course. A decision was made to

					Battle damaged during a mission to government buildings in Berlin, Germany 19May44. On the route in
					moderate flak was observed over Heligoland and Hamburg, Germany. Moderate flak, fair for accuracy,
					was encountered at Lübeck. At Kiel flak was moderate to intense. Because of poor weather and
					consistent contrails, the formation could not keep up with the Division formation, and since it was
					without fighter cover it deviated from route to the primary target and attacked the secondary,

					with B-17G 44-6561 taxying at Kimbolton 4Nov44. Major damage in an accident after takeoff for a
					mission to railway marshalling yards at Neuss, Germany 23Jan45 (9RMC}. The plane was returning early
					with no.1 propeller feathered. The pilot had been advised to divert to Wendling due to zero-zero
					weather conditions at Kimbolton. As the plane broke out of the haze, he realized that he was to the
					right of the runway and too low to make any course correction. He then decided to go around again
					and make a better approach. As he neared the end of the runway, no.2 engine blew a cylinder. With
					no.1 and no.2 engines now out and full power on no.3 and no.4, the bomber went into a 45-degree bank.
					Miraculously, the plane stayed in the air long enough to miss the water tower and the barracks,

					was encountered at several locations en route; flak around Hamburg was intense and accurate. Prior
					to the target, fighter attacks created havoc for five minutes or more as the tight formation of
					bombers became scattered. On the bomb run the plane took a direct hit which disabled the electrical
					system. It also disabled no.1 and no.4 engines, the propellers started windmilling and, without
					electrical power, could not be feathered. The pilot had been injured and it became obvious that the
					plane was not going to fly very much longer so he immediately dropped down to 10,000 feet. Most of
					the crew bailed out bailed out except the navigator and both pilots. Several enemy fighters made two
					passes at the bomber but on each occasion the co-pilot was able to dump the nose just at the right
					moment and avoid getting hit by them. It was obvious that the plane wasn't a good place to stay for
					very long so the remaining airmen bailed out. Crashed at Lauenbrück, Germany. {>67 missions}.

					onboard. The aircraft took-off on runway 350 and immediately banked left climbing to an altitude of
					between 600 and 700 feet. It was now heading south and as it reached the southern boundary of Membury
					airfield the pilot made a 180 degree turn to the left and descended to about 100 feet. By now the plane was
					heading north and making for the 436th TCG Officers Club and squadron accommodation areas.
					As it reached the squadron sites it made a slow right turn which steadily increased until the aircraft
					was banking at an angle in excess of 45 degrees. Unfortunately its right wing tip hit some trees causing
					a loss of control and the subsequent crash and fire that followed. Salvaged 30Apr44.

42-108994		Vultee XP-54 Swoose Goose
				Some databases list this number as being assigned to the cancelled Vultee XP-68 Tornado.
				Vultee Aircraft Corporation Model 84. Second prototype. Ordered March 17, 1942.
				Flight tests of the second prototype (mistakenly painted as 42-1211) began on May 24, 1944 from Downey
				to Ontario, California. Initial trials showed performance to be substantially below guarantees.
				At the same time, development of the XH-2470 engine was discontinued and, although it appeared
				possible to substitute the Allison V-3420 engine without substantial airframe changes, the projected
				delay and costs resulted in a decision not to consider production. The prototypes continued to be
				used in an experimental program until problems with the Lycoming engines and lack of spare parts
				caused termination. It flew nine more times, its last flight being on April 2, 1945.
				The engine/turbosupercharger combination was found to be unsatisfactory and they were returned to the
				manufacturer. Although another engine was fitted to the second XP-54, it was never flown again.
			 	The nose section was sent to Elgin AFB for armament tests; the rest of the airframe was scrapped.
