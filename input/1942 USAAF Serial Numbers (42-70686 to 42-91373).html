				72522 (MSN 10627) to US Navy as BuNo 56499
				72523 (MSN 10628) In the USAFs Assignment Records preserved at Maxwell AFB, C-54D 42-72523 is last
					mentioned when it left regular air force service at Kadena, Okinawa on 9 February 1956 and
					was transferred to an unknown outfit, coded S ATEDEPTDAF.95 The meaning of that code
					is unknown, but it probably stands for: terminated as to regular USAF service and
					transferred to a special unit reporting directly to the Department of Defense / Air Force.
					Since that time, C-54D 42-72523 does no longer appear in the USAF Assignment Records.
					Before 1956, this C-54D had belonged to the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing
					at Kadena, Okinawa. When that unit was deactivated in 1956, most of their C-54s went to the
					332nd Troop Carrier Squadron, Medium (Special), Kadena  reportedly including 2 special
					mission C-54s that the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing had had before, that
					had flown covert missions out of Taiwan during the fifties, often manned by CAT crews,96
					and that in 1959/60 passed to Detachment 2, 1045th OETGP at Kadena.97 But while the later
					history of all the other 8 C-54s operated by the 332nd TCS in late 195698 can be traced from
					the USAF Assignment Records,99 revealing that all but one100 had left South East Asia before
					1960, those 2 special mission C-54s do not appear in the USAF Assignment Records  like
					the 2 special mission C-118s of the same unit.101 So, evidently C-54D 42-72523 was one of
					them, and the second one may have been C-54G 45-558, the one that left regular USAF
					service at Clark AFB and went to top secret on 20 June 1957 and whose previous history
					has been omitted in the microfilm. As one of Major Aderholts men was on the second ill-
					fated C-54, it was possibly already after the first C-54 had been impounded in Mexico that C-
					54D 42-72523 joined the fleet at Retalhuleu. As 2 C-54s were to be used for training at Rayo
					Base initially,102 a second C-54 was needed for October 60. This seems to have been the
					mysterious C-54G HP-320 that was reportedly registered to Los Hermanos, although this
					particular aircraft was also reported to have ditched in a small lake after take-off from NAS
					Jacksonville airport on 15 October 1959 due to incorrect fuel management. Probably the
					aircraft was repaired and used by the Fuerza Aérea de Liberación in the Bay of Pigs because at Puerto Cabezas,
					the actual fleet comprised 10 C-54 transports. These 10 C-54s are believed to have been
					the 2 C-54s that had received official HP- registrations  possibly to be used as call-signs for
					operations out of Retalhuleu  plus the 8 C-54Gs received from the USAF.
					This aircraft is report as operating for Project DAF 53 and is implicated in a UFO sighting by another C-54 en route to Wake Island 14Feb58.

					lorry appeared. The plane had come down in the field opposite the Crown Garage. People were
					running towards the plane and helped dig a hole so that they could get the pilot out as the cockpit
					and front of the plane were upside down, although the rear half was the right way up. The pilot
					was still strapped in his seat but was cut free and taken to Gravesend Hospital where he was
					found to have a broken arm, broken rib and a nasty gash to his hand. On it's way down the plane
					had hit several poles carrying the electricity supply to several properties nearby leaving
					them with no power for any New Year celebrations. The aircraft had run out of fuel on its
					way back to East Anglia and the pilot had tried to land on the road, not knowing that the
					Gravesend airfield was only a couple of miles away. The pilot of the aircraft was returning
					from a mission to provide penetration, target and withdrawal support to heavy bombers
					during an attack on industrial targets in Paris, France. Due to the range and duration
					of the mission, arrangements were made to refuel the squadron at Manston Aerodrome, Kent
					prior to returning to their base at Leiston, Suffolk. Unfortunately there was only
					sufficient fuel for nine aircraft at Manston so the remaining aircraft were given orders to
					go to alternate refuelling aerodromes in South East of England.

					Crashed after engine failure near Lippelo, Belgium November 30, 1943 [the aircraft's first operational
					mission]; Pilot bailed out and taken POW, later escaped. The fighter was on a mission escorting B-17s
					and B-24s to Sölingen, but the engine developed a vapour lock. The fighter turned for home.
					Over Belgium, the problem was solved and the pilot decided to attack some ground targets.
					Near Puurs he dived to the ground and strafed a train. However, he was flying so low he hit a
					telegraph pole which bent the propeller blades. The pilot pulled back on the control stick and
					was able to climb high enough to bail out, whilst his fighter plane plunged into a meadow at
					Mariekerke. The pilot was able to escape the German occupying forces and with the help of
					local Belgians, he arrived in Brussels, where he was sheltered by the underground organisation EVA.
					Unfortunately, in July 1944 he was arrested in the capital and jailed. When the liberation of
					Brussels took place, Bill and many other Allied airmen were locked in a train, from which they
					finally managed to escape. The wreckage was recovered by the BAHA archeaology team July 21, 2001
					and the engine is on display at the Brussels Air Museum. One of the men watching the recovery
					was the pilot; he returned home with the items he touched the last before baling out, parts
					of his control stick and his seat belt. MACR 1542.

					A flight of P-47s was returning from an aerial gunnery mission, which took them just north of
					NAS Wildwood. They encountered some Navy F4U Corsairs and proceeded to dogfight with them.
					This practice was routine, but strongly condemned by both the Army and Navy. The official records
					make no mention of the Navy planes, but witnesses on the ground observed the entire event. They
					claim that the plane began to smoke during a high-speed maneuver with the Corsairs. Officially,
					the pilot noticed smoke coming from the engine while over the coastline and headed for NAS Wildwood
					to make an emergency landing. The pilot said in his statement I headed for Wildwood Navy Field
					and as I passed over the coast, I could see smoke coming from the engine. I checked all engine
					instruments and as far as I could remember they were within green limits. About one mile from
					Wildwood, some oil was thrown on the windscreen. At this time the smoke looked too bad for a forced
					landing and my flight leader instructed me to bail out. I rolled the ship upside down in a stall
					and dropped out. My right leg hit the tail and was cut slightly. Several seconds later the chute opened.
				75488 (MSN 3839) 135th Base Unit, 1st AF, Millville Field, NJ; Force landed 3Jan45 with mechanical
					failure at Millville, NJ. Accident during a ground gunnery mission and destroyed 7 miles SW of
					Millville, NJ March 13, 1944. The pilot was flying number three position; the number four
					man was late in taking off, so they proceeded to the ground strafing range as a three ship
					flight and made a dry run on the target. Number four joined on before they made the next pass
					and was behind number three. "As I turned on approach to the target, I decided I was too close
					to the number two man to fire on the target, so I moved out to the left a little. I started on
					a dry run, and immediately as I started to pull up from the target, the engine seemed to
					lose all power. At about the same instant, the airplane seemed to be mushing in a very nose
					high attitude and went into the trees, which must have knocked off the tail assembly, or at
					least the elevators because there was no vertical control. The plane went up into the air
					momentarily and started down in a steep dive. When it finally stopped, I was still conscious
					and was attempting to get out, as fire was all around the plane. I had to unfasten the safety belt
					and unsnap my parachute and dingy strap, before I could get out. I managed to free myself
					and proceeded to get away from the plane as fast as possible. My head was bleeding freely,
					so I folded my handkerchief up into a pad and put it over the cuts on my head. Then I put my
					helmet back on to put pressure on the wound. I proceeded to the strafing area which seemed to
					be a block or more away. I attempted to signal the airplanes firing but failed to do so.
					The three airplanes in my flight continued making passes until their ammunition was gone,
					then another four ship flight came over and started making passes at the targets. I had been
					circling my Mae West around over my head trying to attract attention, but with no results.
					I knew they did not miss me yet because the other ships came in to fire. By this time I had
					walked down to the road which runs across the range and I stayed there until the four ships left,
					all this time I was circling my Mae West over my head. When the four ship left the range,
					I decided that I should start walking, so I proceeded West up the road. I went about
					three blocks when I noticed a single aircraft circling the range and thought that maybe
					he could be looking for me so I walked back. About that time, I got to the clearing the plane
					had left, so I started back up the road. All the time that the aircraft were firing on the range,
					there was a cloud of thick black smoke coming up where I crashed and the planes had to fly
					by it on their pattern. After I had walked up the road for some distance, I saw the red
					flashing light of the crash truck coming down the road.

				77136 28th Troop Carrier Squadron, Sicily, prepared Feb 14, 1444 to takeoff with the 42-77136 glider in tow. Pilot
					was given the signal to takeoff and made a successful takeoff. Soon after takeoff, the
					glider pulled to one side in an extreme position, and started to pull the tow plane into a spin.
					The pilot was forced to cut the glider loose. After the airborne glider was released,
					it dove for the ground on an angle of about forty-five degrees to the left.
					It hit the ground in an open field and was demolished to a point that it was hard
					to recognize what it had beeWhen the pilot returned to base, he
					found that the glider was loaded with a jeep but no crew or passengers were in it.
					The following day men of the motor pool went to the scene of the crash for the
					purpose of salvaging parts of the jeep. They found that the jeep had been so
					crushed and torn into shreds that no parts were of value

				77432	 73rd Troop Carrier Squadron, 434th Troop Carrier Group, Ninth Air Force, Fulbeck (Station 488).
					Eight C-47s with gliders were ready for takeoff for another training flight 21Feb44.
					This glider was flying in the end of the formation, the No. 8 position. Take off was normal and
					the flight proceeded as planned. The glider pilot cut loose from the tow plane a few
					seconds after No.7 released. It made a normal turn to the left and slowed the gliders
					speed with use of spoilers to avoid getting to close to No.7 glider. On the final
					approach the pilot stayed to the right and to the rear of No.7. It was then it came into
					the propeller wash causing a loss of 150. Believing he was still making the proper
					approach the pilot began holding the glider off the ground as long as possible to make
					up for the lost altitude. Looking to the ground he could see nothing; it was then that it
					hit C-47A 42-100507 causing damage to the left wing tip, left wing, left de-icer boot
					and aileron. Then the gliders right wing hit another C-47A 42-24039 damaging the left
					wing and wing tip, the left propeller and aileron and accessory cowling section that
					swung the glider around the front of the plane causing damage to the right wing
					leading edge and de-icer boot. The glider damage was: right wing smashed and loose
					in its connection to the fuselage, left wing badly torn and also loose from the fuselage.
					Fuselage at the wing boots was bent and torn and the pilots greenhouse was damaged slightly.
					The right hand door didnt open; the fuselage was slightly bent. The accident investigation
					concluded that the pilot of the glider failed to release at the proper time and landed
					short of his objective. Propeller wash may have contributed to loss of altitude but
					was only indirectly responsible for the accident.

				78839 On 1Aug43 the glider, built by contractor Robertson Aircraft Corporation and based at Stout Field,
					Indianapolis, IN, lost its right wing and plummeted to earth immediately after release by a tow
					airplane over Lambert Field, St. Louis, Missouri. Several thousand spectators had gathered for
					the first public demonstration of the St. Louis-built glider, which was flown by two USAAF
					crewmen and carried St. Louis mayor William D. Becker, Robertson Aircraft co-founder
					Maj. William B. Robertson, and six other VIP passengers; all ten occupants perished in the crash.
					The accident was attributed to the failure of a defective wing strut fitting that had been
					provided by a subcontractor that had previously manufactured caskets; the post-crash
					investigation indicted Robertson Aircraft for lax quality control; several inspectors
					were relieved of duty.

					After a low pass in formation with a Lockheed P-38 Lightning and a North American P-51 Mustang
					on each wing, its pilot attempted a slow roll but lost altitude and crashed, sending flaming debris
					into occupied civilian ground vehicles on a highway near the airfield. The pilot,
					a veteran of 80 combat missions over Germany, was killed and five civilians were critically injured.
					One of the injured was the driver of an automobile who had just asked a State Highway Patrolman
					how to get into the field and was in the act of turning his automobile around when it was struck.
					His wife and two young children in the automobile were also injured.

					Luke Field to fly a two hour navigational flight. When the aircraft was approximately
					thirty miles south of Phoenix, it changed course to head west directly over the towering
					Sierra Estrella Mountain Range. As the pilot entered a canyon, he was level with a s
					addle he intended to fly over. The aircraft climbed with the intention of having a 1,000 foot
					clearance over the saddle but failed to gain altitude. As the pilot approached the crest, he
					realized he would not make it over the top and tried banking left to turn around, but his
					left wing struck a boulder and caused the aircraft to cart-wheel and crash.
					The fuselage was torn loose from the center section, and with the pilot still inside,
					rolled down fifty feet into a steep ravine and came to rest upside down. Pilot survived. Supposedly
					to reclamation/scrap at Luke AAF, AZ Jul 5, 1945, but wreck is still on-site.

					World Wide Aeronautical Industries, CA. Shipped to USA, arrived dismantled, Santa Paula, CA Sep91.
					Registered 19Sep91 as N3173L. The aircraft collided with the runway while landing at
					Daugherty Field, Long Beach, California 28Jul95. The aircraft sustained substantial damage;
					however, neither the pilot nor his passenger were injured. This leg of the flight originated in
					Porterville, California, on the day of the accident. The aircraft arrived at Long Beach as No 4
					in a flight of four aircraft. The flight passed over Daugherty Field to the west, turning back
					over the Queen Mary, and then north for an overhead break for landing. The pilot temporarily
					lost sight of the three other aircraft as they descended on the approach, but regained visual
					contact after he saw the first two touching down and the third on short final for the runway.
					The break had placed the pilot south of the final approach path so he turned back to the north
					to intercept final. After he rolled out on final he recognized that there was a right crosswind and
					crabbed into the wind anticipating a crosswind landing. After touchdown, the aircraft veered
					sharply to the right as the left main landing gear collapsed. After the aircraft contacted the
					runway it slid off the right side striking an electric runway-taxiway sign with frangible mounts
					on a 0.25-inch high concrete base. The pilot stated that at the time aircraft control was lost, he
					was applying right aileron and left rudder to compensate for the crosswind. The aircraft sustained
					damage to the left wing tip, left aileron, left wing inboard of the landing light, the left main landing
					gear, and propeller. The mechanical down lock for the left main landing gear was broken and
					displaced from its installed position atop the left strut. The left strut was found at a 45-degree angle
					and was pushed through the wing surface. The mechanical indicator for gear position did not
					show the left main gear to be in the down and locked position. Registration current [Jun20]. Race #69 Eros

					Ontario for inspection and preparation for return. Returned to USAF 24Feb54. 3040th Aircraft
					Storage Squadron, Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, AZ 29Jul54. Reclaimed 29Sep55. Registered 1958
					as N7421C. Used in the TV movie The Tuskegee Airmen [1995]. Damaged landing at Atwater, CA 27Sep98.
					During the landing roll the aircraft tail wheel was not properly engaged and according to the pilot,
					he momentarily felt as if it was binding when the pilot over corrected and scraped the right wing tip
					and aileron on the ground. Damage was noted on the right wing tip fairing and the right aileron outboard
					hinge was broken from impacting the ground. Damaged when crash landed at Parowan, UT 28Jul00.
					The pilot stated that he "placed landing gear down prior to base entry, checked gear indicator, checked lights,
					and gear pins"(top of wing). After making a two point landing and rolling two thirds down the runway,
					the right gear folded followed by the left. Maintenance could not identify a cause following inspection
					and functional tests of the landing gear system. It is suspected that since the gear handle is close to the
					flap handle that the pilot may have inadvertently retracted the landing gear instead of the flaps.
					Sustained substantial damage when it struck taxiway signs and a ditch on the landing rollout at the
					Ernest A. Love Field, Prescott, Arizona 5May01. The purpose of the flight was to receive transition
					training flight instruction to include take-offs and landings. The CFI stated that on the accident landing
					there were no discrepancies noted until the airplane was struck by a gust of wind just as it touched
					down. He initiated a go-around and then decided to abort the go-around due to a ditch off to the right
					side of the runway. The CFI stated that he had not been aware of the ditch. He applied full opposite
					rudder and brake, but was not able to control the airplane. The CFI reported that as the airplane
					went to the right towards the ditch, it struck taxi signs. The airplane "traveled through the ditch
					and out the opposite side." The airplane was taxied to the ramp. Registration expired 31Dec13,
					cancelled 26Jan18. Reregistered 18Sep18 as N7421C; current [Jan20].
