					Operated for Canadian Forest Protection Limited spruce budworm spray program New Brunswick 1956-57;

					from Charlo airstrip in the northern part of New Brunswick when five planes were forced down near
					Penniac, just north of Fredericton, NB 5Jul57. All the pilots escaped serious injury as heavy fog and
					fuel exhaustion were the main cause of the accident. Two of the aircraft were extensively damaged.
					The squadron was headed to Fredericton Municipal Airport to refuel but the airfield was fogged in.
					They were over Penniac when one plane was forced down in a field. Two Stearmans circled over the
					field until the pilot signaled that he was OK; they then ran out of fuel near Charters Settlement.
					This and another Stearman were also low on fuel. They were over the small community of Durham
					Bridge when the pilot saw his flying partner head for an opening in the clouds. He followed down
					through the hole in the clouds and they suddenly saw an L-shaped pasture that looked appealing
					for an emergency landing. His partner went for it, but there was no way both planes could land there
					together at the same time because of the chances of collision. This pilot flew over the field and saw that
					his partner had landed safely, so he landed at the far end of the field and taxyed along to where his
					partner was. By this time the fuel gauge was reading empty. There was no damage to either of the
					Stearmans. A man had been driving home to Nashwaak Bridge, had seen the planes land and drove
					up to offer help. He took them to a local store where they used the phone to inform an official
					at the Fredericton Airport of their situation. Then they obtained some fuel at a local bulk station,
					convincing the attendant to bill it to Wheeler Airlines, and returned to fuel up their planes.
					Eventually they took off and headed to Fredericton Airport by following the local roads. After a period
					of searching, they found the runway and both planes landed safely. The rest of the squadron returned
					to the Taxis airstrip, six miles west of Boiestown, New Brunswick. The pilot was cleared to return to
					Arizona the next day, but he had significant engine trouble on the way. Because of massive oil loss,
					the pilot had to force land in a field near Sullivan, Missouri. Crashed and destroyed during aerial
					application seeding cotton when the engine failed caused by sand in a cylinder pulling up at the end of a
					swathe run and stalled during the forced landing at Goodyear, AZ 18Jun69 (1INJ). Registration revoked 2Apr77,

					attached to 19th Bomb Group 2Dec41. This was one of six B-17s that took off from San Marcelino airfield,
					Luzon en route to Clark Field, Philippines 10Dec41 (2KIA:1WIA;6RTD). Only three landed; this B-17 plus
					B-17D 40-3091 and B-17D 40-3086. The other three did not land fearing a Japanese air raid. In haste,
					this B-17 was only partially armed with three 600lbs bombs before departing. It was one of four B-17s
					that took off to bomb Japanese ships off Aparri and Vigan. The convoy had been spotted during the
					night and bombed during the first American bombing mission of the Pacific War earlier that morning.
					Arriving over Aparri, the crew headed for a concentration of warships off the coast. Spotting the heavy
					cruiser Ashigara (falsely claimed to be battleship Haruna) the bombardier jettisoned all three bombs
					from 22,000ft, claiming one hit and observed a seaplane taking off from the deck. In fact, no battleship
					was part of the invasion force and no damage was suffered aboard Ashigara; the ship damaged may
					have been the minesweeper W-19. Prior to landing back at Clark Field, the B-17 was intercepted by
					Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters of the Tainan Kokutai; the Japanese had tailed the bomber
					from Aparri back to Clark. During their first firing pass, the nose compartment was hit, damaging the
					pilot's instrument panel. The Zeros made repeated firing passes and started a fire in the bomb bay
					which engulfed the rear of the bomber in flames. Heavily damaged, the pilot ordered the crew to bail out.
					As they opened their parachutes, several were strafed by the Zeros until they reached the ground,
					making holes in their parachutes. Meanwhile, the B-17's two right engines were inoperative when an
					explosion ejected the co-pilot out of the observation dome, but he was able to open his parachute and
					landed safely. All the surviving crew landed in the vicinity of their base and quickly returned to duty.
					As the stricken bomber descended, it exploded again and impacted the ground. The wreckage was found
					along a rural road two miles west of Mount Arayat, about five miles east of Clark Field. The tail assembly
					was missing. Parts were scattered over an area of 500 yards. The right wing with two engines still in
					place remained almost intact although it was burning when the search party arrived. The fuselage and
					left side of the plane were badly wrecked and burned. First USAAF B-17 lost in combat. Capt Colin P. Kelly killed.

					9th Bomb Squadron, 7th Bomb Group, Fort Douglas, Salt Lake City, UT 27Jun41.. The bomber departed
					Fort Douglas with five crew and four passengers 31Oct41. The destination of the flight was the Sacramento Air
					Depot, McClellan Field, California where the No.3 engine with over 420 hours on it was to be replaced. After
					a two day stopover in Reno, NV because of bad weather to the west, they departed late on the morning on an
					instrument flight to their destination 2Nov41. There was no Command Set installed on this aircraft so the
					flight crew relied on their Compass Set radio to navigate to the airfield in Sacramento. After passing Lake Tahoe,
					the plane entered into the overcast sky. Then, after several minutes, the radio begun to static, and communications
					were down to the point where they were unable to check it at Donner Summit. Attributing the loss of radio
					functions to a temporary static condition, the pilot continued on to Sacramento via a more southerly route.
					Then, at that moment, the No.1 supercharger began to have problems maintaining pressure. With the aircraft
					in a climb towards 14,000ft, the co-pilot attempted to manipulate the supercharger controls to add additional
					pressure to it. Being partially successfully, the pressure continued to change, but not lost entirely, the flight
					continued onward. Then, after 45 minutes of flight, the flight indicators all ceased working. With the vacuum
					pumps having problems, and the pitot tube heat being turned on, no clear cause could be determined for this
					difficulty. The pilot and co-pilot decided to head back to Reno. Throttling up the engines to climb to 18,000ft,
					the aircraft pulled to the right. The flight crew, trying to hold the B-17 in a straight line of flight, cut the engine
					power to try again. After a more successfully attempt, the pilot and co-pilot realized they were having serious
					troubles controlling the airplane, the pilot ordered the crew to don parachutes as a precaution, and be ready
					to bail out of the aircraft. With their bank-and-turn instrument being the only functioning guide, the aircraft
					seemed to be handling fine. Then, the nose rose slightly, the pilot compensated by pushed the controls downward.
					The pilot, attempting to level off the aircraft's descent, realized that flight controls had been lost. He attempted
					to pull the controls back to regain attitude, but the aircraft then rolled over onto its back, righted itself for a
					brief moment, and then plummeted into a spin. As the aircraft began to break apart, six of the crew were able
					escape by jumping out. Two were thrown from the plane. All eight of these airmen parachuted to safety,
					leaving the pilot trapped in the cockpit as the bomber plummeted down to earth; he did not make it out. T
					he aircraft crashed on Tells Peak, near Georgetown, CA (1KIS). Surveyed 5Nov41. Wreck still there.

					An hour later, Brereton called MacArthur again, and asked to move his planes to Mindanao, where they would be out
					of reach of Japanese bombers. MacArthur again told him "no". These planes had their engines running and the
					flight crews were already on board. After the second "no" from MacArthur, the pilots and crew were told to shut down
					and go to lunch. While the crews were at lunch, the Japanese arrived with bombers and fighter planes.

					squadron two-year deployment to the Philippines. It was stripped of all non-essential equipment, including ammunition,
					and had two long range fuel tanks installed in the bomb bays. With the possibility of war being declared,
					General Arnold allowed the crew to take their bomb sight and machine guns. When the crew asked for ammunition
					they were told they would get that in Hawaii. The formation of B-17s arrived in Hawaii during the Japanese attack
					on Pearl Harbor and Hickam Field 7Dec41. This aircraft was attacked by Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter
					from the Akagi, including a Zero whose pilot mistook the bomber as a transport aircraft. His attack scored hits
					on the aircraft, causing damage and wounding two members of the crew, one severely. The pilot diverted to
					Bellows Field, Waim?nalo, Oahu, a small auxiliary fighter field and the nearest alternate location. Approaching
					to land, a Curtiss P-40 Warhawk was being towed across the runway, the driver unaware of the bomber or the
					Japanese attacks, forcing the bomber pilot to make another approach. With smoke trailing from the right engines,
					the pilot touched down long and, realising he was unable to stop, raised the landing gear, slid off the runway,
					over a ditch and stopped in a cane field. It was the last B-17 from the ferry flight to land on Oahu. It was then
					strafed by Japanese fighters, attempting to set it on fire and leaving it riddled with some 73 bullet holes.
					With empty fuel tanks, the plane did not catch fire. The aircraft was repairable but salvaged for parts and the
					rest scrapped. SKIPPER. Named for the engineer's six week old Scotch terrier mix puppy which had flown on

					RAF Watton, Norfolk 3May41. RAF West Raynham, Norfolk 15May41. On 22nd June 1941 the aircraft departed
					from RAF Great Massingham flying the short distance to West Raynham to pick up passengers and crew for
					the test flight. Then took off from West Raynham, the purpose of the flight was to allow physiological research
					and tests to be done at high altitude. On board alongside the crew of five airmen were two senior medical
					officers in the rear of the aircraft and a further qualified pilot who was to take temperature readings
					in the cockpit cabin. The aircraft was to fly at an altitude of 30,000ft so that a problem resulting in oxygen
					masks freezing was to be investigated and an assessment of the energy used by air gunners while in
					combat was also to be monitored. An hour after taking off and while flying between 30,000 and 31,000ft
					the aircraft entered a large cumulonimbus cloud. The temperature in the aircraft was estimated to have
					dropped by some 20 degrees and pieces of ice began to enter through the open rear gun ports. After around a
					minute of flying in these conditions the aircraft entered a steep and high-speed dive after control was lost
					while flying in this very turbulent weather. The pilot was able to regain some control briefly and was able
					to begin to pull out of the dive but before the aircraft fully pulled out of the dive the forces on the airframe
					were too great and the port wing spar failed at around 25,000ft. The port wing broke off at around the port
					outer engine nacelle and this was followed by the disintegration of the aircraft in the air. None of the six crew
					in the front of the aircraft stood any chance with none able to attempt to abandon the aircraft because of the
					forces involved and they went down with the aircraft. The two medical officers in the rear of the aircraft had
					both been able to reach their parachutes and clip them onto their harnesses, one of these officers became
					wedged by the port guns and although the other man was able to free him he then abandoned the aircraft
					through the starboard gun port and landed safely. The other medical officer remained unable to get himself
					clear of the aircraft and he also went down with the aircraft. Because of the height this aircraft broke up
					at the wreckage was spread over a wide area from the region of Catterick racecourse in the south-west and
					extended to some six miles north-east of Catterick Bridge. The port wing section was found towards the
					north-east end of the trail while much of the cockpit section, the engines and most of the fuselage were
					found nearer the south-west end. Part of a wing section was found resting against the rear of the Farmers Arms
					pub at Catterick Bridge and further fragments of the aircraft were in the fields beyond this pub. It is likely
					that a restricted oxygen supply caused by freezing at altitude caused the pilot to lose control (7KIA:1RTD).
					Salvaged 9Jul41. At the time of the accident it had flown a total of 66 hours. First B-17 lost in WWII. The second
					pilot was 1st Lt Follett Bradley Jnr, USAAC who became the first American casualty of WWII.

					360th Bomb Squadron, 303rd Bomb Group. The aircraft took off on a patrol and search mission from
					Hickam Field, TH 15Jun42 (2MIS:7RTD). The plane had some equipment failures affecting communication
					and navigation. Returning to base, the pilot reported that he was low on fuel and did not know his
					position with a 300ft cloud ceiling. Running into a storm and with fuel exhaustion causing the No.2
					engine to stop. When the No.3 engine was about to stop, the pilot feathered the propeller. This caused a
					loss of instruments so was restarted. The pilot held the plane off the water until the airspeed decayed
					and ditched off Oahu, roughly 145 miles away. After ditching, one life raft was released and the top
					escape hatch failed to open. Two of the crew were not seen again and reported as missing. The other
					seven crew survived unhurt in the raft. MACR 16123.

					This bomber, along with B-17D 40-3062 proceeded to the target together. Over the target, ten enemy fighters
					were observed taking off from Davao airfield to intercept them. Both B-17s climbed to 28,000ft in hopes
					of climbing above their effective altitude, but were intercepted by the fighters. The other B-17 was
					hit in the engine, causing it to slow down and 40-2072 also slowed to maintain formation and provide
					mutual fire support. Next, this aircraft was hit by machine gun and cannon fire. Aboard, one man
					was killed before the fighters broke off their attack. The B-17s descended to wave top height and successfully
					landed at Batchelor Field, NT, Australia. On the ground, more than one hundred holes were noted on this bomber.
					No.1 Aircraft Depot, RAAF Laverton, Melbourne, VIC for repairs Dec41. Damaged and abandoned at Bandoeng
					West airfield, Andir, West Java. Salvaged by Dutch Air Force personnel and flown out by the Dutch 4Mar42,
					landing safely at Geraldton, Western Australia. Later, the aircraft was based at RAAF Garbutt, Townsville,
					QLD flying via Jackson Field (7 Mile Drome), Port Moresby on bombing missions over New Guinea.
					Designated 22Oct42 as RB-17C. This aircraft spotted two survivors from B-24D "Lady Beverly" 41-23760
					in the sea near Baibara Island off the southern coast of New Guinea 15Nov42. Accident returning from a
					mission 24Dec42. The aircraft dove from 20,000ft to 12,000ft; when the bomber pulled out of the dive,
					the wing flexed causing permanent structural damage but returned to Australia safely. After the dive, the
					bomber's wingtips were a foot higher than normal. No.1 Aircraft Depot, RAAF Laverton, Melbourne, VIC for
					repairs. Repairs were attempted, but instead the B-17 was declared "war weary" and reassigned.
					All armament and flooring were removed and the plane converted for use as a transport. 21st Troop
					Carrier Squadron, 374th Troop Carrier Group, RAAF Garbutt, Townsville, QLD Jan43. 46th Troop Carrier
					Squadron, 317th Troop Carrier Group, RAAF Garbutt, Townsville, QLD Jan43. Mackay airfield, QLD Mar43.
					Early 1943 the plane was flown to RAAF Laverton for a major service. While over-nighting in Sydney
					on the return to Mackay or Townsville, the crew was at The Rocks near the Sydney Harbour Bridge when
					a large ship passed under the bridge. The plane captain made a profound statement, "If a ship can pass
					under that bridge so can an airplane", or similar. The next morning, the plane was reported to have flown
					under Sydney Harbour Bridge. Operated with Australian radio call sign VH-CBA. Flew Allied servicemen
					and supplies from rest and recuperation in Australia via Mackay airfield back to Jackson Field (7 Mile Drome),
					Port Moresby, New Guinea and vice-versa. Crashed after take off from Mackay airfield 14Jun43
					40KIS:1INJ - six crew and thirty-five passengers). The plane struck a tree after it became airborne and,
					instead of making a ninety degree turn to the right for a straight course to New Guinea, the pilot made a
					270 degree turn to the left presumably to avoid the town during the return to the airfield. The Fortress
					caught fire in the air and, as it dived into the trees, one of its wings came away leaving a great opening
					in the fuselage through which most of the passengers were emptied into the bush before the final impact.
					Crashed at Bakers Creek, south of the airfield. This crash was the single worst aviation disaster during WWII
					in Australia, or in Australian aviation history. The plane was en route to Port Moresby, New Guinea,
					taking troops back to their units after they had spent ten or more days on R&R in Mackay.

					The aircraft was part of an unarmed flight that departed
					Hamilton Field, San Rafael, CA bound for Hickam Field, Honolulu, TH 6Dec41. It was due to
					fly from USA to Luzon in the Philippines via Hawaii, Midway, Wake Island, Port Moresby and
					Darwin as part of a ten squadron two-year deployment to the Philippines. It was stripped of
					all non-essential equipment, including ammunition, and had two long range fuel tanks
					installed in the bomb bays. With the possibility of war being declared, General Arnold allowed
					the crew to take their bomb sight and machine guns. When the crew asked for ammunition they
					were told they would get that in Hawaii. The formation of B-17s arrived in Hawaii during the
					Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Hickam Field 7Dec41. While on finals to land at Hickam Field,
					two Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters opened fire from the rear, hitting the bomber's flare box,
					causing it to catch fire and fill the fuselage with smoke. The pilot aborted the landing and
					attempted to hide in clouds, but due to the smoke quickly landed. After touching down and rolling
					roughly 400ft, the fuselage, weakened by the fire, buckled and broke off, separating from the front
					half of the bomber. A passenger flight surgeon was KIA by Japanese aircraft strafing fire as
					he ran from the aircraft. The plane was not repaired.

					B-17 shot down and that interception by the Bf 109s was inevitable, the pilot jettisoned the bombs
					and climbed to 34,000ft. This caused problems with the oxygen supply and both waist gunners
					suffered anoxia. Dropping down, the bomber became a target for the Bf 109 flown by
					Uffz. Karl-Heinz Woite of 2./JG 77, cannon shells hitting both gunners. Despite other crew injuries

					planes to Mindanao, where they would be out of reach of Japanese bombers.
					MacArthur again told him "no". These planes had their engines running and the flight crews were already on board.
					After the second "no" from MacArthur, the pilots and crew were told to shut down and go to lunch.
					While the crews were at lunch, the Japanese arrived with bombers and fighter planes.

					The same day Pearl Harbor was bombed, General Brereton, the Air Corps commander in the Philippines,
					had all his planes ready to takeoff to bomb Japanese air bases in Formosa;
					he called General MacArthur to ask for his permission to do so.
					MacArthur replied by telling him "no, leave your planes on the ground".
					An hour later, Brereton called MacArthur again, and asked to move his planes to Mindanao,
					where they would be out of reach of Japanese bombers.
					MacArthur again told him "no". These planes had their engines running and the flight crews were
					already on board. After the second "no" from MacArthur, the pilots and crew were told to shut down
					and go to lunch. While the crews were at lunch, the Japanese arrived with bombers and fighter planes.
					The B-17s were lined up in straight rows at Clark Field. All but six of the planes were destroyed

					blew a tire on takeoff and aborted the mission. This bomber, along with B-17C 40-2072 proceeded
					to the target together. Over the target, ten enemy fighters were observed taking off from Davao airfield
					to intercept them. Both B-17s climbed to 28,000ft in hopes of climbing above their effective altitude,
					but were intercepted by the fighters. This B-17 was hit in an engine by flak, causing it to slow down
					and 40-2072 also slowed to maintain formation and provide mutual fire support. Next, this aircraft
					was hit by machine gun and cannon fire. Aboard, two men were wounded before the fighters broke

					an engine had been hit during combat, a 37mm anti-aircraft shell had struck and weakened one
					of the wing spars, causing the plane to fly with one wing about 10 degrees below the other and
					crab along at low altitude and low speed. Five hours into the flight, two engines died before the
					bomber landed safely after seven hours at Batchelor Field, near Darwin, NT 27Jan42.
					Crashed on takeoff from Batchelor Field en route to Laverton 28Jan42. The left engines failed
					causing the plane to crash near the end of the runway and slid towards an anti-aircraft gun
					battery manned by the Australian Army. Roughly one hundred yards from them, the B-17 hit a
					tree stump that spun the bomber halfway around and flung the navigator through a window and
					he died on impact (1KIA:4RTD). During the crash, the B-17 sustained damage including the left
					wing tip and all four propellers were bent backwards. Afterwards, written off and towed
					to the scrap area of Batchelor Field and salvaged. Today, some wreckage remains at the site
					and is protected by the Northern Territory as a heritage site.

					Ditched in the Central Pacific Ocean eighty miles south of Diamond Head, Hawaii 2Oct42 (1MIA:1DOI:7RMC).
					Edward V. "Eddie" Rickenbacker (WW1 fligjter ace) was sent on a tour of the Pacific theater to review conditions,
					operations, and to personally deliver a secret message from President Roosevelt to General MacArthur.
					The aircraft took off from Hawaii, bound for a refuelling stop at Canton Island, Phoenix Islands.
					It went off course with a navigation error caused by an out-of-adjustment celestial navigation instrument,
					a bubble octant that gave a systematic bias to all of its readings.
					That octant reportedly had suffered a severe shock in a pre-takeoff mishap during the first attempt to takeoff
					in a different bomber, but the landing gear's brakes seized mid-takeoff.
					The navigator kept the same damaged bubble octant which caused the navigational failure.
					The plane's aircraft commander was forced to ditch close to Japanese-held islands but the
					Americans were never spotted by Japanese patrol planes.
					The USAAF and USN searched for more than two weeks, but failed to find anything.
					Rickenbacker's wife convinced them to extend the search another week.
					The press reported that Rickenbacker had died.
					The seven crew used two life rafts. Rickenbacker still suffered from the airplane crash,
					his friend sustained serious injuries in the water landing, and others in the crew were hurt to varying degrees.
					The crew's food supply ran out after three days. They drifted at sea without food or water aside from an
					occasional fish and rain. On the eighth day a seagull landed on Rickenbacker's head, he caught it and the
					men meticulously divided it equally and used some for fishing bait.
					On the thirteenth day, one of the crew died and was buried at sea, leaving only six survivors.
					Rickenbacker assumed a role of leadership, encouragement, and browbeating to help the others survive,
					and encouraged them to turn to the Lord for solace. According to Rickenbacker, each person on the rafts
					converted to Christianity after the experience. Three of the survivors decided to separate and departed together.
					They found a small island, close to another, inhabited one. The natives of the second one were hosting an allied radio station.
					They were taken to an English missionary on the island, until rescued by a US Navy tender.
					On the seventeenth day, the other survivors saw an aircraft, but it failed to spot them.
					More planes were spotted on the eighteenth and nineteenth days, but they failed to spot them.
					US Navy pilots located the surviving crew members off the coast of Island X near Samoa.
					A Navy patrol plane spotted the captain on the evening of the twenty-first day, 12Nov42
					and a PT Boat rescued him. Twenty-two days after the crash, 13Nov42 an OS2U Kingfisher crew
					spotted the raft with Rickenbacker and two other crew members off the coast of Nukufetau in Tuvalu and landed.
					Already dark, the Kingfisher loaded one inside the cockpit. Rickenbacker and the other crew member were
					strapped to the wing. The Kingfisher taxyed on the surface for more than thirty minutes to a nearby PT Boat,
					where they were transferred. Rickenbacker completed his assignment and delivered MacArthur's secret message.
					No one ever made the message public. This accident later resulted in improved navigation tools for aircraft, and improved survival gear
					MACR 16348 was written after the war and does not list the serial number of the plane or give the date of loss.

					This was one of six B-17s that took off from San Marcelino airfield, Luzon en route to Clark Field
					for re-arming prior to a combat mission. Only three landed; this B-17 plus B-17D 40-3091 and B-17D 40-3086.
					The other three did not land fearing a Japanese air raid. In haste, this B-17 was armed with eight 600lbs
					bombs before departing. It was one of four B-17s that took off to bomb Japanese ships off Aparri and Vigan.
					The convoy had been spotted during the night and bombed during the first American bombing mission of
					the Pacific War earlier that morning. Arriving over Aparri, the crew found a number of troop transports lined
					up on the beach. As the pilot turned for another pass it was attacked by a Nakajima Ki-27 of the 50th Sentai
					flown by 2/Lt Teizo Kanamaru, bullets causing damage to both wings, an engine and ruptured an oil tank.
					Anti-aircraft fire had also riddled the tail section. The pilot dived into a cloud bank and headed back for a
					safe landing at San Marcelino airfield. Only able to make temporary repairs, the pilot later took off for a return
					to base at Del Monte. En route, the pilot received a false message that Del Monte was in Japanese hands.
					With insufficient fuel to return to Luzon, he force landed at Cebu. Preparing to depart Cebu back to Del Monte,
					the crew discovered that an aileron cable was holding by only one strand and would have to be replaced;
					the bomber finally reaching Del Monte 13Dec41. Flown to Australia but considered
					uneconomical to repair and w/o Dec, 27, 1941 at Darwin, Australia and converted to components.

					Battle damaged on a mission from Del Monte to bomb Japanese shipping at
					Legaspi, Albay, Philippines 14Dec41 (1KIA:3WIA). With an engine failure, the pilot dropped down
					and was able to restart the engine. It approached the target at 9,500ft when it was attacked by
					five Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, damaging the fuselage and killing the radio operator
					and wounding three gunners. More fighters arrived and damaged the No.1 engine engine with the
					aircraft dropping down to 3,500ft. The No.4 fuel tank was punctured, seven out of eleven control
					cables had been cut. The tail wheel was hanging down and both main wheel tires were flat.
					Out of ammunition, the fighters departed and the B-17 headed back to Del Monte. The pilot was
					unable to control the plane and realised that he would not be able to fly over the mountains
					surrounding Del Monte. Obscured by heavy cloud and with night time approaching, the pilot was
					forced to crash land on a small airfield near Cagayan, Mindanao. Coming in too low, the plane
					hit the top of some palm trees. Despite the flat tires, the bomber landed normally and rolled

					Departed Hickam Field 5Sep41 and flew via Midway airfield, Eastern Island, Midway Atoll; Wake airfield,
					Wake Atoll; Jackson Field (7 Mile Drome), Port Moresby, New Guinea to Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines arriving 12Sep41.
					The aircraft flew 600 miles to a partially completed landing strip at the Del Monte, Mindanao,
					Philippines pineapple plantation on the island of Mindanao 5Dec41.
					Having successfully carried them halfway around the world, the crew had grown attached to this particular
					 Flying Fortress and they named the bomber "OLE BETSY".
					This B-17 flew what was likely the first American combat mission of the war when it took off from
					Del Monte airfield on a reconnaissance mission 8Dec41.
					Evacuated from the Philippines departing Del Monte airfield and flew to Batchelor Field, near Darwin, NT 20Dec41.
					Finding the tail of the B-17 weakly protected from rear fighter attacks, mechanics of the 93rd Bomb Squadron rigged a
					stinger in the tail 21Dec41.
					A 0.30 caliber machine gun was installed which could be operated by pulling a cable at the waist position.
					Operated a shuttle mission from Batchelor Field against Japanese forces at Davao 22Dec41,
					arriving after dark, the first American night bombing mission of the war.
					The plane landed at Del Monte to refuel and re-arm.
					Departed the following morning on a mission to a Japanese task force in Lingayen Gulf, returning later to Del
					Monte and then, after dropping bombs on Davao, back to Batchelor Field.
					Soon after taking off, it experienced engine trouble and bombed the alternate target at Davao arriving after dark,
					the first American night bombing mission of the war.
					Ferried from Batchelor Field to Singosari airfield on Java 30Dec41.
					Took off from Singosari airfield on a mission against Tarakan 11Jan42.
					Over the target, three enemy fighter aircraft mounted a 35-minute attack,
					damaging the bomber; the crew claimed two of the attackers.
					The damage was extensive enough to end the aircraft's career as a bomber.
					Condemned 18Jan42.
					No.1 Aircraft Depot, RAAF Laverton, Melbourne, VIC, Australia for a complete overhaul late Jan42.
					During the repair, this bomber was fitted with a new tail scavenged from B-17D 40-3091.
					After repairs, 19th Bomb Group pilot Captain Weldon Smith nick named the aircraft "The Swoose"
					after the popular song Alexander the Swoose about a bird that was "half swan, half goose: Alexander is a swoose".
					Afterwards, this aircraft never returned to first-line duty, instead flying navigation and escort missions
					for fighters and anti-submarine patrols, until withdrawn from duty Mar42.
					Selected to be the personal aircraft for Lt. General George Brett, Commander of Allied Air Forces in Australia.
					Lyndon Baines Johnson, the future 36th President of the United States, was sent by President Roosevelt
					on a tour to check morale. He hitched a ride back to Australia from New Guinea in the bomber after
					participating in a bombing raid on Lae, New Guinea, in a Martin B-26 Marauder 9Jun42.
					The plane departed Jackson Field (7 Mile Drome), Port Moresby, New Guinea and flew over Horn Island, QLD,
					and then headed for Batchelor airfield in the Northern Territory then to Darwin, NT 10Jun42.
					The plane departed Darwin with Johnson and eleven other VIPs and headed for Longreach, QLD via
					Daly Waters, NT and Cloncurry, QLD 11Jun42.
					Problems with the navigator's octant and sloppy flying when each of the VIPs was
					given the chance, put the plane seriously off course. Unable to find Cloncurry or Longreach and with fuel
					exhaustion, the pilot force landed on a farm forty miles southwest of Winton at Carisbrook Farm.
					Flown to Longreach and on to Melbourne, VIC 12Jun42. Returned to US.
					After the wings were waxed for speed by a team of Australian WAAFs, the bomber flew back to the USA
					with General Brett 4Aug42. The airplane broke the speed record flying from Sydney, Australia, to
					Wellington, New Zealand. In New Zealand, the crew removed all armament, lightening the bomber by
					hundreds of pounds, and then broke another speed record during a flight to Honolulu.
					It was a record breaking flight, breaking Sir Charles Kingsford Smith's trans-Pacific record in a
					flight time of 36 hours and 10 minutes from Brisbane to San Francisco arriving at Hamilton Field,
					San Rafael, California. The aircraft continued to serve General Brett.
					Middletown Air Depot, Middletown Field, PA 21Aug42; "picked up under questionable status to MAD per budget Report 8-21-42".
					Langley Field, Hampton, VA 23Aug42. Bolling Field, Washington, DC 26Aug42.
					North American Aviation, Wichita, KS 29Aug42.
					Middletown Air Depot, Middletown Field, PA 20Oct42.
					Bolling Field, Washington, DC 26Oct42.
					Flown to Albrook Field, Panama City, Panama Canal Zone 9Dec42.
					To the Panama Air Depot (PAD) at Albrook Field, Panama City, Panama Canal Zone for work
					and was extensively modified, completed January 1943. Returned to US 13Mar43.
					Returned to PAD for additional work between April and July 1943 but continued to make flights
					during this period.
					By 1944, the aircraft required extensive repairs following an inspection during February that
					revealed cracked wing spars and corrosion that required the replacement of the inner wing panels.
					A conference was held at Sixth Air Force Service Command to determine if the repairs were cost effective 7Mar44.
					A pair of B-17D inner wing panels was discovered at France Field, Panama Canal Zone and these were
					shipped by barge to Albrook Field via the Panama Canal 8Mar44. Deciding to proceed, "Swoose"
					 returned to PAD and the major overhaul and rework on the entire airframe was begun 20Mar44.
					General Brett personally inspected the work, then only 45% complete 22Apr44.
					During this overhaul, four additional passenger seats and a galley were added and equipment
					brought up to model E standards. On the nose, the flags of all nations the aircraft had visited were painted.
					Repairs were completed on 1Jun44, but cost more than the aircraft itself when newly built.
					Designated RB-17D. Returned to US 7Nov44.
					237th Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station-Very Heavy), Kirtland Field, Albuquerque, NM 7Nov44.
					Used by General Brett until Dec45 when he personally flew it from Mines Field, Los Angeles, CA
					(now Los Angeles International Airport) to Kirtland Field, New Mexico.
					To Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Storage Depot No.41, Kingman Field, AZ 12Jan46 for storage and disposal.
					The aircraft was saved by the efforts of Col. Frank Kurtz, who flew this bomber during the war.
					Kurtz flew the B-17 to Mines Field, Los Angeles, CA with passengers aboard including the mayor of Los Angeles 6Apr46.
					Following acceptance ceremonies, airport personnel stored "Swoose" inside a hangar at the airport.
					Plans for a war memorial fell through and Frank Kurtz arranged for the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC
					to acquire the aircraft instead. During May 1948, Kurtz flew "Swoose" to the old Douglas C-54 assembly plant,
					the 803rd Special Depot at Orchard Place Airport, Park Ridge, Illinois.
					The building served the Smithsonian as temporary storage for a large number of museum aircraft.
					In June 1950, the Korean War began and the US Air Force claimed the Park Ridge facility for military use.
					An Air Force crew flew the plane to Pyote Field, TX airfield in Texas for storage 18Jan52.
					2753rd Aircraft Storage Squadron, Air Materiel Command, Pyote AFB, TX.
					The Air Force agreed to move the bomber to Andrews AFB, Maryland, and store it there with other Smithsonian aircraft.
					"The Swoose" began its last flight 3Dec53. This trip was not without incident and during the afternoon of the 5th,
					two engines quit. At dusk, a third engine failed just before touchdown at Andrews.
					For the next six years this historic aircraft was stored outdoors at the base and vandals almost picked the bomber clean.
					Finally, in April 1961, to save what remained of the airplane from total destruction,
					the Smithsonian disassembled and trucked the 60-year-old veteran to the National Air and Space Museum's
					Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility at Silver Hill, Maryland.
					During July 2008, "The Swoose" was moved from the National Air & Space Museum Paul Garber Facility to
					the USAF Museum, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, OH arriving 14Jul08. "The Swoose" is undergoing an extensive
					restoration which is expected to take a number of years.

					other bombers destroyed in the attack and flown to Del Monte, Mindanao, Philippines for further repairs 9Dec41.
					Destroyed when crashed on takeoff from Del Monte 12Dec41. Two engines failed and, without the hydraulic
					system, the plane skidded off the grass runway and was ground looped, catching the nose of a parked
					B-17D 40-3087 and inflicting serious damage before breaking in half. Condemned 18Jan42

					bombed and strafed Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines 8Dec41 (8KIA). The plane exploded, breaking
					the fuselage in two and the engines had melted off the wings. Eight crewmen had been running from
					the plane when they were killed by the explosion. . Condemned 18Jan42.
					The same day Pearl Harbor was bombed, General Brereton, the Air Corps commander in the Philippines,
					had all his planes ready to takeoff to bomb Japanese air bases in Formosa; he called General MacArthur
					to ask for his permission to do so. MacArthur replied by telling him "no, leave your planes on the ground".
					An hour later, Brereton called MacArthur again, and asked to move his planes to Mindanao, where they
					would be out of reach of Japanese bombers. MacArthur again told him "no". These planes had their
					engines running and the flight crews were already on board. After the second "no" from MacArthur,
					the pilots and crew were told to shut down and go to lunch. While the crews were at lunch,
					the Japanese arrived with bombers and fighter planes. The B-17s were lined up in straight rows
					at Clark Field. All but six of the planes were destroyed

					and was disturbing large clouds of dust. A pilot lost control, departed the runway and slammed
					into the parked B-17. The bomber's fuel tanks were ruptured, caught fire and exploded, setting off
					ammunition in the loaded 0.50 caliber guns. The fighter pilot was killed and both planes destroyed. Condemned 18Jan42.
